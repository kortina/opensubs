2
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,490
Hey. Pull up at the corner.

3
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,915
Wait here.

4
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,221
How.

5
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:26,099
Good afternoon, sir.

6
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:57,047
Yes?

7
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:02,795
I'd like to see the boss.
What'd you say his name is?

8
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:05,514
- I didn't say.
- Cagey, huh?

9
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:08,133
Mr. Boot is the owner and publisher.

10
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:11,303
Okay. Tell Mr. Boot
Mr. Tatum would like to see him.

11
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:13,847
Charles Tatum from New York.

12
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:16,140
What about?

13
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:20,854
Look, fan, just ask him, how would he like
to make himself a fast $200 a week?

14
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:23,774
What did you say you were selling?
Insurance?

15
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:25,984
I didn't say.

16
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:28,078
Cagey, huh?

17
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,472
Now, isn't that something?
Who said it?

18
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:58,684
Well, Mr. Boot said it,
but I did the needlework.

19
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:01,311
- Oh.
- Okay.

20
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,105
I wish I could coin 'em like that.

21
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:05,190
If I ever do,
would you embroider it for me?

22
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,290
Oh.

23
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:12,739
- Mr. Tatum?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,908
- Go ahead. What is it?
- Well, Mr. Boot.

25
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,704
I was passing through Albuquerque.
Had breakfast here. Read your paper.

26
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:20,998
Thought you might be interested
in my reaction.

27
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:25,169
- You bet I am.
- Well, sir, it made me throw up.

28
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:27,963
I don't want you to think
I expected the New York Times.

29
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:31,049
But even for Albuquerque,
this is pretty Albuquerque.

30
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:32,885
All right. Here's your nickel back.

31
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:35,345
Now, what's all this
about my making $200 a week?

32
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,139
Apparently, you're not familiar
with my name.

33
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,724
Can't say that I am.

34
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,851
That's because you don't get
the Eastern papers out here.

35
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:43,770
I thought maybe once in a while somebody
would toss one out of the Super Chief...

36
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,939
and you might have seen my byline.

37
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,566
Charles Tatum?

38
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,735
Worked New York, Chicago, Detroit.

39
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:52,913
- What about the 200?
- I was coming to that.

40
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,910
Mr. Boot, I'm a $250-a-week
newspaperman.

41
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,746
- I can be had for 50.
- Why are you so good to me?

42
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:03,207
I know newspapers
backward, forward and sideways.

43
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,918
I can write 'em, edit 'em,
print 'em, wrap 'em and sell 'em.

44
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:09,129
- Don't need anybody right now.
- I can handle big news and little news.

45
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:12,182
And if there's no news,
I'll go out and bite a dog.

46
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:18,021
- Make it 45.
- What makes you so cheap?

47
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,601
A fair question, considering I've been
top man wherever I've worked.

48
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:25,187
You'll be glad to know
that I've been fired from 11 papers...

49
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,731
with a total circulation of seven million...

50
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:30,359
for reasons with which
I don't want to bore you.

51
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:33,161
Go ahead. Bore me.

52
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:39,952
I'm a pretty good liar.
I've done a lot of lying in my time.

53
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:43,038
I've lied to men who wear belts.
I've lied to men who wear suspenders.

54
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:47,543
But I'd never be so stupid as to lie to a
man who wears both belt and suspenders.

55
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,294
How's that again?

56
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:53,757
You strike me as a cautious man...
a man who checks and double-checks.

57
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,009
So I'll tell you why I was fired.

58
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:58,637
In New York,
a story of mine brought on a libel suit.

59
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:02,558
In Chicago, I started something
with the publisher's wife.

60
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:04,768
In Detroit, I was caught
drinking out of season.

61
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,861
- In Cleveland...
- I get the picture.

62
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:11,316
Now then, I find myself in Albuquerque
with no money...

63
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,987
a burnt-out bearing, bad tires
and a lousy reputation.

64
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:17,072
Bad tires can be dangerous.

65
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,408
I have only one chance
to get back where I belong...

66
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,994
to land a job
on a small-town paper like yours...

67
00:06:22,094 --> 00:06:25,122
and wait and hope and pray
for something big to break...

68
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:27,124
something I can latch onto...

69
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:30,586
something the wire services
will gobble up and yell for more.

70
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:33,088
Just one good beat...
a Tatum special...

71
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:36,049
and they'll roll out the red carpet.

72
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,678
'Cause when they need you,
they forgive and forget.

73
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:43,773
But until then, Mr. Boot, you'll get yourself
the best newspaperman you ever had.

74
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:47,102
At 40 per. When do I start?

75
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:49,187
Don't push.

76
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:52,232
- I hope I haven't scared you off.
- Well, I don't know.

77
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm not afraid of a libel suit,
because I'm a lawyer myself.

78
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,487
Check and double-check
every word I print.

79
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,364
Sure. Belt and suspenders.

80
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:00,907
About that publisher's wife.

81
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,577
I think you should know Mrs. Boot
is a grandmother three times.

82
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:06,538
If you wanna start something with her,
she'd be very flattered.

83
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:08,832
As for drinking... Do you drink a lot?

84
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,709
Not a lot. Just frequently.

85
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,420
We have a shop rule here.
No liquor on the premises.

86
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,173
- Uh, how about smoking?
- Of course.

87
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:19,267
And, uh, I pay 60 a week in this shop.

88
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,770
I'll take it.

89
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,059
- Where's my desk?
- The one by the door.

90
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,653
You may be outta here by Saturday.

91
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,906
The sooner, the better.

92
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:03,253
Thanks, Geronimo.
Take these over to the engraver's.

93
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:05,714
What's this mess?

94
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,709
They haven't got any chopped chicken liver.
I brought you some chicken tacos.

95
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,294
Chicken tacos?

96
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:12,087
They're not gonna chop the livers
anymore for you.

97
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,931
Nobody else'll buy them.
And no more garlic pickles.

98
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:21,471
When the history
of this sunbaked Siberia is written...

99
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:24,308
these shameful words
will live in infamy:

100
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:26,818
"No chopped chicken liver."

101
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,898
No garlic pickles.

102
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:35,652
No Lindy's.
No Madison Square Garden.

103
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:37,704
No Yogi Berra.

104
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:41,241
What do you know about Yogi Berra,
Miss Deverich?

105
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,577
- I beg your pardon?
- Yogi Berra!

106
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:46,705
Yogi?
Why, it's a sort of religion, isn't it?

107
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:50,675
You bet it is...
a belief in the New York Yankees.

108
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:54,296
You know what's wrong
with New Mexico, Mr. Wendell?

109
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:56,306
Too much outdoors.

110
00:08:57,308 --> 00:09:01,845
Give me those eight spindly trees
in front of Rockefeller Center any day.

111
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:03,813
That's enough outdoors for me.

112
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:08,485
No subways smelling sweet-sour.

113
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,731
What do you use for noise around here?

114
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:17,577
No beautiful roar from eight million ants
fighting, cursing, loving.

115
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,665
No shows. No South Pacific.

116
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,503
No chic little dames
across a crowded bar.

117
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,456
And worst of all, Herbie...

118
00:09:29,556 --> 00:09:33,418
no 80th floor to jump from
when you feel like it.

119
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:35,754
Is this one of your
long-playing records, Chuck?

120
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:38,590
Let's hear the other side.

121
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,802
All right. I'll play it for you.

122
00:09:41,902 --> 00:09:46,598
When I came here, I thought this was
gonna be a 30-day stretch, maybe 60.

123
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,392
Now it's a year.

124
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:50,644
It looks like a life sentence.

125
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:54,523
Where is it?
Where's the loaf of bread with a file in it?

126
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:57,701
Where's that big story
to get me outta here?

127
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:01,446
One year, and what's our hot news?

128
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,623
A soapbox derby.

129
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,787
A tornado that double-crossed us
and went to Texas.

130
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:12,082
An old goof who said he was
the real Jesse James...

131
00:10:12,182 --> 00:10:14,584
until they found out he was
a chicken thief from Gallup...

132
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:17,429
by the name of, uh, Schimmelmacher.

133
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:21,007
I'm stuck here, fans.

134
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:23,017
Stuck for good.

135
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:26,304
Unless, of course, you...

136
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:30,183
Miss Deverich,
instead of writing household hints...

137
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:33,270
about how to remove chili stains
from blue jeans...

138
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,905
get yourself involved
in a trunk murder.

139
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:39,109
How 'bout it, Miss Deverich?

140
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,738
I could do wonders
with your dismembered body.

141
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:45,123
Oh, Mr. Tatum. Really.

142
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:51,163
Or you, Mr. Wendell.

143
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,999
If you'd only toss that cigar
out of the window...

144
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:58,795
real far, all the way to Los Alamos...

145
00:10:58,895 --> 00:11:00,688
And boom!

146
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:03,600
Now, there would be a story.

147
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:08,388
I told you, no liquor in the office.

148
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:10,182
I thought I could trust you.

149
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:13,318
What a suspicious nature
you have, Mr. Boot.

150
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:15,945
Hmm.

151
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:17,856
Pretty, isn't it?

152
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:21,234
I make those things every night when
I go home, out of matches and toothpicks.

153
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:24,029
It calms my nerves.

154
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:26,239
Sorry, Tatum.

155
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,909
- Maybe you do need a change.
- Do I.

156
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:32,913
And I got news for you. You're going
out of town for a couple of days.

157
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:35,791
- How far and in what direction?
- Los Barrios County.

158
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,710
They're having a rattlesnake hunt,
and I want you to cover it.

159
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,837
- A rattlesnake hunt?
- That's right.

160
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:43,590
And take Herbie along.
Let's get some art.

161
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,385
A rattlesnake hunt.
Well, isn't that ginger-peachy?

162
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:50,055
A real "stop the press,
pull out the front page..."

163
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:51,807
"...get ready to replate" assignment.

164
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:53,850
Have a nice time, Chuck.
See the country.

165
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,444
And don't worry.
I'll put the paper to bed.

166
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:02,826
Well, it looks like we're starting
our second year with a real bang.

167
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:06,120
Okay, fan, pack up.

168
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,958
You know, this could be
a pretty good story, Chuck.

169
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:19,751
Don't sell it short.

170
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:22,087
It's quite a sight...
a thousand rattlers in the underbrush...

171
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:24,673
and a lot of men smoking them out
and bashing in their heads.

172
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:28,768
Big deal. A thousand rattlers
in the underbrush.

173
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:34,232
Give me just 50 of them
loose in Albuquerque.

174
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:37,769
Like that leopard in Oklahoma City.

175
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:39,938
The whole town in panic.

176
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:43,483
Deserted streets.
Barricaded houses.

177
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,986
They're evacuating the children.

178
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:48,572
Every man is armed.

179
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:52,117
Fifty killers on the prowl. Fifty.

180
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:55,412
One by one,
they start hunting them down.

181
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:57,622
They get 10, 20.

182
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:01,209
It's building.
They get 40, 45. They get 49.

183
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,753
Where's the last rattler?

184
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:06,172
In a kindergarten? In a church?

185
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:08,383
In a crowded elevator? Where?

186
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,976
I give up. Where?

187
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:14,681
In my desk drawer, fan.

188
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,183
Stashed away.
Only nobody knows it, see?

189
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,185
The story's good
for another three days.

190
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:22,063
Then when I'm good and ready,
we come out with a big extra.

191
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:25,066
"Sun-Bulletin Snags Number 50."

192
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,861
Where do you get those ideas?

193
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:32,490
Herbie, boy, how long did you go
to that, uh, school of journalism?

194
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,534
Three years.

195
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,753
Three years down the drain.

196
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:41,750
Me, I didn't go to any college,
but I know what makes a good story.

197
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,253
Because before I ever worked on a paper,
I sold 'em on a street corner.

198
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:47,672
You know the first thing I found out?

199
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:50,016
Bad news sells best.

200
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,686
Because good news is no news.

201
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,689
Better get some gas.

202
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:19,337
Hey! Anybody here?

203
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:23,299
Hey!

204
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:36,938
Service!

205
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,196
Anybody home?

206
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:00,586
Sorry to bother you, lady.

207
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:06,509
I'd like to buy some gas.

208
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,280
Hey, there's something screwy
about this place.

209
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:30,616
There's just an old lady
in there that's...

210
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:44,330
What would the law be doing up there
in that old Indian cliff dwelling?

211
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,417
Maybe they got a warrant for Sitting Bull
for that Custer rap.

212
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:50,128
Come on, Herbie.
Let's go visiting. It's for free.

213
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:52,255
I can get the gas on the way back.

214
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,257
That is, if she's stopped praying.

215
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:56,134
- Who?
- That old lady in there.

216
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:57,886
What's she praying for?

217
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:01,139
I don't know, but whatever she's
praying for, she's sure praying hard.

218
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,239
Hmm.

219
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:05,276
Maybe it ties in. Let's see.

220
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:24,079
Oh. I thought you were the doctor.

221
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:26,498
- What's the matter? Somebody hurt?
- We don't know yet.

222
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:29,417
- He's way in there, under that mountain.
- What happened?

223
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:31,419
We had a cave-in this morning.

224
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,838
- Oh. That so?
- Dumb cluck.

225
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:37,133
Everybody keeps tellin' him,
"Stay outta that place. Stay outta there."

226
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,135
Not Leo. Stubborn like a mule.

227
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,846
He always keeps goin' back,
diggin' for those Indian pots.

228
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:44,232
- Who's Leo?
- My husband.

229
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:50,571
Oh. Well, I'm sorry
to hear about it. Hop in.

230
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,370
- You live around here?
- Yeah.

231
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,038
I'm Mrs. Leo Minosa.

232
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,791
We own that trading post
down on the highway.

233
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,836
Finest store in downtown Escudero.

234
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:15,755
Is that what they call this place?
Escudero?

235
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:18,383
Got a couple of other names
for it myself.

236
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:22,137
Did the Indians really live
in that place 450 years ago?

237
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:25,014
I wouldn't know.
I haven't been around that long.

238
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:27,559
It only seems that long.

239
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:30,353
Say, if you gents stopped by to see
that broken-down cliff dwelling...

240
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,730
you sure picked a swell day.

241
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,899
All right. Let's have the facts.
You're his father?

242
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:36,651
Yes. I'm his father.

243
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:40,079
- How long has he been inside?
- Pretty near six hours now.

244
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,740
How far down you think he is?

245
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,828
Oh, about 250 or 300 foot,
I should judge.

246
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:49,497
Best we could do
was to get in about halfway.

247
00:17:49,597 --> 00:17:51,166
You gotta watch yourself.

248
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:53,376
Swing that pick too hard
in them old walls...

249
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:56,421
you start a sand slide
and block up the whole place.

250
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,055
Then good-bye, Leo.

251
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:05,930
- Is that coffee good and hot, Lorraine?
- Sure, it's hot.

252
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,141
The sandwiches are in the blanket.
So are the cigars.

253
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:10,476
- How's Mama?
- All right, I guess.

254
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:13,813
- How do I find my way?
- Just follow our rope. We left it in there.

255
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:16,482
After that, holler. He'll yell back.

256
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:18,943
Wait a minute, you.

257
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:21,279
Nobody goes no place here
without I say so.

258
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,324
He's cold. He's hungry. We've got to
let him know we're doing something.

259
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:27,202
Look, I got my hands full already
without havin' two of ya in there.

260
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:30,371
- Somebody's got to go.
- How about those Indians?

261
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:33,958
What do you say, Chief? You oughta
know your way around here pretty well.

262
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:36,336
They won't go in. They never do.

263
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:38,421
- Bad spirits.
- Ah, go on.

264
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:40,590
What are you holdin' out for,
a couple of bucks?

265
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,302
He says it's their holy mountain.

266
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,763
The Mountain of the Seven Vultures.

267
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:49,515
The Mountain of the Seven Vultures.

268
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,609
It's got a sound to it.

269
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:54,904
Get me a few shots, Herbie.

270
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:02,528
Looks like it's your move, copper.
What's it gonna be?

271
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:04,656
I'm thinkin'. Don't rush me.
I'll do somethin'.

272
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:09,035
You could always give that poor fellow
in there a ticket for parking overtime.

273
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,620
Let me have those things.

274
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,372
Who do you think you are,
buttin' in like this?

275
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:14,207
- Let me have your flashlight.
- Who is he?

276
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,709
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm the guy who's going in that cave.

277
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:19,837
And you're the guy that's been sounding off
long enough. Now give me your flashlight.

278
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:22,131
- Why, you...
- Shut up.

279
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:24,225
Come on, Herbie.

280
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:28,680
Thanks, mister, and God bless you.
Tell him we'll get him out.

281
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,431
- Tell him not to worry.
- Okay.

282
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:33,017
Sure. And tell him we'll have
a big coming-out party for him...

283
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,361
with a brass band and everything.

284
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,719
Here's the rope.

285
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,929
I hope we can get to him.

286
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,029
Yeah.

287
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,697
Watch out for those rocks.

288
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:29,949
The old man sure looked bad.

289
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,036
- Did you see his face?
- Yeah.

290
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:35,580
Like the faces of those folks
you see outside a coal mine...

291
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,459
with maybe 84 men trapped inside.

292
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,546
One man's better than 84.
Didn't they teach you that?

293
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:46,591
- Teach me what?
- Human interest.

294
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:51,095
You pick up the paper,
you read about 84 men or 284.

295
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:53,264
Or a million men,
like in a Chinese famine.

296
00:20:53,364 --> 00:20:56,059
You read it,
but it doesn't stay with you.

297
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,269
One man's different.
You wanna know all about him.

298
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,355
That's human interest.

299
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:03,733
Somebody all by himself,
like Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic...

300
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,701
or Floyd Collins.

301
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,696
Floyd Collins.
Doesn't that ring a bell?

302
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:11,282
No, not to me, it doesn't.

303
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,159
You never heard of Floyd Collins?

304
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:15,411
1925. Kentucky.

305
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:17,663
The guy pinned way down in that cave.

306
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:19,540
One of the biggest stories
that ever broke.

307
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,176
Front page in every paper
in the country for weeks.

308
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:26,464
Say, what'd you take at that
school of journalism... advertising?

309
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:29,300
Uh, well, maybe I did hear about it.

310
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,179
Maybe you heard that a reporter on the
Louisville paper crawled in for the story...

311
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,065
and came out with a Pulitzer prize.

312
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:54,542
Guess we'd better not
fool around with that.

313
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,044
Here. Hold this.

314
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:11,634
Now let me have it.

315
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:13,227
And camera.

316
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:17,064
You got a couple of bulbs?

317
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:23,688
You stay here.

318
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:27,024
That sand gets any worse,
let me hear from you, but loud.

319
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:29,444
I don't like the looks of it, Chuck.

320
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:31,537
I don't either, fan.

321
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:35,249
But I like the odds.

322
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,600
Hello!

323
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,353
Hello!

324
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:05,988
Here!

325
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:22,046
Over here.

326
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:26,717
Here.

327
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:30,888
Over here.

328
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:49,815
Hello, Leo. How do you feel?

329
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:53,611
Not so bad anymore.
I thought nobody would ever come.

330
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:57,281
Anything hurt?
Any bones broken?

331
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,033
No, I guess not.

332
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,785
Can't you get your legs
out from under?

333
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,711
What do you think
I've been tryin' to do?

334
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,706
They're pinned under me.

335
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:08,217
Maybe... Maybe I can help.

336
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:11,679
Hey, watch it! Watch it!

337
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:15,716
You want those rocks
to come down on my head?

338
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:17,969
I didn't know they were that shaky.

339
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:19,637
They're all pretty shaky.

340
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:23,349
It's an old place...
been comin' apart for a long time.

341
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:25,768
Looks like we'll have to
take them out one by one.

342
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:29,522
Don't try it by yourself.
It's gonna take a lot of figuring.

343
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:32,567
The way they are now, if one goes,
they'll all go... roof and everything.

344
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:35,820
I see what you mean.
Well, here.

345
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,823
Wrap yourself in this blanket.

346
00:24:38,923 --> 00:24:41,542
And get some of this hot coffee
inside of you.

347
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:44,870
Thanks, mister.

348
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,290
- A cigar.
- Your wife sent them.

349
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,085
She did? That's funny.
She always beefs when I smoke a cigar.

350
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:54,005
- Hey, what's your name, mister?
- Charlie Tatum.

351
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,932
Just driving by the trading post
when I heard about it.

352
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,469
Hey, what happened
to those other fellas?

353
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,138
I heard them, but they went away.

354
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:03,973
Why don't they do somethin'
about gettin' me out?

355
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:06,726
Easy, Leo. They'll get you out.
But you know what you just said.

356
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:09,895
It takes figuring,
maybe some special equipment.

357
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:11,606
They're not gonna leave me here
overnight?

358
00:25:11,706 --> 00:25:15,651
They'll do it as fast as they can,
but they gotta do it right.

359
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:17,528
Yeah, I know.

360
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:19,288
Only that's a pretty heavy mountain.

361
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,616
Tell me, Leo. How'd it happen?

362
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:25,620
I... I guess I crawled in
too far this time.

363
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,705
You've got to to find a good one.

364
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:30,132
Back there,
it's pretty well cleaned out.

365
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:35,679
But I found me a beauty.
Worth 50 bucks any day.

366
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,600
It's then the whole floor
caved in under me.

367
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:43,646
I guess maybe
they didn't want me to have it.

368
00:25:44,814 --> 00:25:46,766
They? Who are "they"?

369
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:49,226
The Indian dead.

370
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:51,228
They're all around here.

371
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:54,565
This is a tomb, mister,
with mummies 400 years old.

372
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:57,401
They used to bury them here
with these jars alongside...

373
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:59,487
you know, full of corn and wampum.

374
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:02,239
That's worthwhile knowing, Leo.
Go on.

375
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:05,868
I... I guess maybe
they've been watchin' me...

376
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:08,788
all the time I've been takin' things
outta here and got mad.

377
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:10,839
Bad spirits, huh?

378
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:16,420
I guess you're gonna laugh at me,
think I'm crazy.

379
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,131
But when you lie down here
all by yourself, you get to thinkin'.

380
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:21,342
Do me a favor, will ya?

381
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:25,012
Hold up that jar again.
And look at me.

382
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:27,932
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Taking your picture.

383
00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:31,477
- What for?
- Gonna put it in the paper.

384
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:34,522
- What kind of paper?
- In a newspaper in Albuquerque.

385
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:36,107
- My picture?
- Certainly.

386
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,483
Honest?

387
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:40,194
Everybody wants to see how you look.
And I'm gonna write a story.

388
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,613
They'll wanna know all about you.
They'll be pulling for you.

389
00:26:42,713 --> 00:26:45,825
How do you like that?
Me in a paper.

390
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:49,378
- Let's take another one, Leo.
- Oh, let me wipe my face first.

391
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:52,314
Hold it.

392
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:54,291
And don't say anything
about those Indian spirits.

393
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,378
- I don't want anybody to think I'm scared.
- Don't worry, Leo.

394
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:59,797
I'm your pal.

395
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:02,383
I know.
That's why I can talk to you.

396
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:04,635
Sure, you can.

397
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:08,013
You know, in the army,
I was plenty scared too.

398
00:27:08,113 --> 00:27:10,149
Like when my outfit landed in Italy.

399
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:13,519
Only in the army, it's different.

400
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:15,404
There, everybody's scared.

401
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:19,241
Your barge is gonna land.
You know you're gonna die.

402
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,528
And then a guy starts singin'.

403
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:24,447
Soft-like.

404
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:27,241
Then a guy next to you starts singin'.

405
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,376
Pretty soon, you're singin' too.

00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:46,685
Nah, not a thing...
except I got the mumps in Naples.

411
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:49,930
Well, you light yourself a cigar, Leo.
I gotta say so long.

412
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,266
- I certainly wish you could stay a while longer.
- So do I.

413
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:55,060
But there's a lot to do outside
getting things organized.

414
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,446

Just a couple of pals singin'.
What's wrong with that?

Guard 'em with your life.

Let's get moving.

439
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,811
What happened?

440
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:21,647
- Aren't you gonna tell me?
- Quiet, Herbie. Quiet.

441
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:24,650
- I'm writing the lead to the story.
- Well, what is the story?

442
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,750
Big.

443
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:30,531
As big as they come, I think.
Maybe bigger than Floyd Collins.

444
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,542
- Floyd Collins plus.
- Plus what?

445
00:29:34,544 --> 00:29:36,412
Plus King Tut.

446
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:38,205
You remember that one, don't ya?

447
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:41,633
The curse of the old Egyptian pharaoh
when they came to rob his tomb.

448
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:44,587
How's that for an angle?

449
00:29:44,687 --> 00:29:47,131
King Tut in New Mexico.

450
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:49,758
Curse of the old Indian chief.

451
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:52,686
White man half buried
by angry spirits.

452
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:55,514
What will they do?

453
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:57,808
Will they spare him?
Will they crush him?

454
00:29:57,908 --> 00:30:01,145
Give it to me straight, Chuck.
How does it look? Can they get him out?

455
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,814
- Huh? Certainly.
- How soon?

456
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:06,066
I don't know.

457
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,827
Floyd Collins lasted 18 days.

458

for anything like that.

463
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,418
I'm not wishing for anything.

464
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:27,638
I don't make things happen.
All I do is write about them.

465
00:30:41,277 --> 00:30:42,770
- Did you reach him?
- I saw him.

466
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,521
- Couldn't you bring him out?
- I talked to him.

467
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:46,315
- Is he alive?
- You can be sure of one thing.

468
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:47,858
- We'll get him out.
- Today? Tonight?

469
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,693
I'm afraid not. There's nothing
we can do here tonight.

470
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:50,793
Tomorrow?

471
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:52,863
Or as soon as we get
an engineering crew on the job.

472
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:56,667
And I'm gonna get them, Mr. Minosa...
the best. And I'll get that doctor.

473
00:30:58,878 --> 00:30:59,930
And the sheriff too.

474
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,913
The sheriff's tied up in
Los Barrios until Monday.

475
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:05,125
- You better talk to me.
- Tied up in Los Barrios, huh?

476
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:08,879
I'll bet he's at that rattlesnake hunt.
Chances are the doctor too.

477
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:11,882
How do you like that?
A man could be dying here, and...

478
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:15,302
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Minosa.
- I know all about that sheriff.

479
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:18,931
He stops in every week for a steak dinner
and never picks up the check.

480
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:22,226
He'll be here.
They'll all be here...

481
00:31:22,326 --> 00:31:25,153
the sheriff, the doctor, the engineer.

482
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:28,232
- You got a phone at the trading post?
- Yeah.

483
00:31:28,332 --> 00:31:31,326
Let's get started.
We got a lot of telephoning to do.

484
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:42,170
- The phone's inside.
- Okay.

485
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,499
Fill her up, Herbie.
You're going back to town.

486
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,791
Right.

487
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:50,595
Over there.

488
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:54,925
There's the doctor's number.
Dr. Hilton.

489
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:57,019
The sheriff's number's there too.

490
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:01,314
Oh, that's the sheriff, huh?
"Gus Kretzer."

491
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,393
We'll get some action here.
You'll see.

492
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:07,271
By tomorrow, this place will be jumping
if I have to call Santa Fe...

493
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:09,606
and get the governor out of bed.

494
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:12,609
Oh, would it be too much trouble
to put me up for the night?

495
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:15,487
Sixty beautiful rooms.
The Escudero Ritz.

496
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:18,498
What'll it be?
Ocean view or mountain view?

497
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,951
Anything.

498
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:23,837
A cot. A couple of chairs
in here will do fine.

499
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:33,589
Operator?
Get me Albuquerque 4923.

500
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:36,091
- What's the number here?
- Escudero 2.

501
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:37,684
Escudero 2.

502
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,768
Hello?

503
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:55,110
Sun-Bulletin?
This is Tatum speaking.

504
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,537
Get me Mr. Boot, and make it fast.

505
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,502
Mr. Boot? Tatum.

506
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:14,379
No, nothing's wrong.
Quite the contrary.

507
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:17,341
Uh-uh. I'm in a dreamy little spot
called Escudero...

508
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:19,802
about three hours down the line.

509
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:22,012
Forget the rattlesnakes.

510
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:23,972
We got somethin' nicer here.

511
00:33:24,072 --> 00:33:26,725
We got birds... vultures.

512
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:28,435
Seven of them.

513
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:30,020
How does this hit you?

514
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,107
"The Curse of the Mountain
of the Seven Vultures."

515
00:33:33,207 --> 00:33:36,026
Of course you don't know what
I'm talking about, but I'm gonna tell you.

516
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:38,912
And wait till you see the pictures.
I'm sending them up with Herbie...

517
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:42,950
No, I'm not drunk, Mr. Boot.

518
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,911
Maybe a little excited,
because unless war is declared tonight...

519
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:47,830
here's your front-page feature.

520
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,122
Now...

521
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:06,056
How much is it, Mr. Minosa?

522
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:07,975
No, sir, I wouldn't take your money...

523
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:10,652
not after all you're doing for my boy.

524
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:55,215
- Hi.
- Morning.

525
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:04,508
The construction boss show up?
Or the sheriff?

526
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:06,051
Not yet.

527
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:08,929
From the way you were talkin', I thought
you'd get the governor down here.

528
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:11,848
- The marines too.
- It's all taken care of.

529
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:14,017
They got a construction crew
together... machinery too...

530
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:16,895
and they're on their way from
Los Barrios now, Sunday or no Sunday.

531
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:18,563
- Yap, yap.
- I've talked to the doctor.

532
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:21,191
We're taking him in
as soon as they clear the passage.

533
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,402
And the sheriff
will be on the job too.

534
00:36:23,502 --> 00:36:25,237
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

535
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:28,699
Look, madam,
when I say I deliver, I deliver.

536
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:31,034
Where are the old folks?

537
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:33,295
Went to early mass.

538
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:38,625
What's that you been playin'
on your typewriter all night?

539
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:42,129
From upstairs, it sounded like
that "Saber Dance."

540
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:45,056
With all this trouble,
I didn't think you could sleep anyhow.

541
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:50,012
I've had enough sleep...
five years of it.

542
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:52,222
What else could you do
in Escudero...

543
00:36:52,322 --> 00:36:54,016
look at the family album?

544
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:57,144
- Where'd you get it?
- From Mama Minosa.

545
00:36:57,244 --> 00:36:58,979
Just shows.

546
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:01,565
Yesterday,
you never even heard of Leo.

547
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:04,526
Today, you can't know
enough about him.

548
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:06,453
Aren't you sweet?

549
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,742
Good-lookin' kid in his uniform,
wasn't he?

550
00:37:11,842 --> 00:37:14,786
Him and eight million other guys.

551
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:17,914
See our wedding picture?
Bet you didn't even recognize me.

552
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:20,258
Sure, I did.
You were a brunette then.

553
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,421
In '45? No, in '45, I was a redhead.

554
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:26,214
See how skinny I was?

555
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:29,760
A hospital back in Baltimore
said I had a touch of T.B.

556
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,770
You'd never think it
to look at me now.

557
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:34,981
You don't look like
a chest case to me.

558
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,853
If you can spare this one,
I'd like to take it along...

559
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,947
in case I forget what he looks like.

560
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:46,026
What time is it?

561
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:49,112
Quarter to 6:00.
What's all this about?

562
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:51,823
- I'm grabbin' the early bus.
- Where to?

563
00:37:51,923 --> 00:37:55,744
Outta here... fast.
As far as 11 bucks will take me.

564
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:57,829
I'm blowin' this place.

565
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:01,375
- Well, you picked a fine time.
- I've left him before.

566
00:38:01,475 --> 00:38:03,585
Once, I got as far
as Dodge City, Kansas...

567
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:06,296
in a big, blue convertible
that stopped by for gas.

568
00:38:06,396 --> 00:38:08,390
It must have cost 4,000 easy.

569
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,968
But Leo caught up with me.

570
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:14,137
I told him I was through.

571
00:38:14,237 --> 00:38:16,306
I told him it was no good anymore.

572
00:38:16,406 --> 00:38:19,142
- This isn't for me.
- What is?

573
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:21,978
I bet he took you out of
some dime-a-dance joint in Baltimore.

574
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:24,564
- Nightclub.
- Saloon.

575
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:26,525
All right. Saloon.

576
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:28,110
You know what he told me?

577
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,447
He told me he had 160 acres
in New Mexico and a big business.

578
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:33,990
Look at it.

579
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,660
We sell eight hamburgers a week
and a case of soda pop.

580
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,079
And once in a while,
a Navajo rug maybe.

581
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:42,833
He married ya, didn't he?
Brought you out here, fed ya, nursed ya.

582
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:47,337
And I thanked him plenty.
I've been thankin' him for five years.

583
00:38:47,437 --> 00:38:49,431
That makes us even.

584
00:38:51,434 --> 00:38:53,760
So long, Jack.

585
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,353
Nice kid.

586
00:38:57,106 --> 00:38:59,182
Got a little jump on him
this time, huh?

587
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:02,269
Can't run after you, not lying there
with those rocks on his legs.

588
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:05,147
Look who's talkin'.
Much you care about Leo.

589
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:07,149
I'm onto you.
You're workin' for a newspaper.

590
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:09,359
All you want
is somethin' you can print.

591
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:13,288
Honey, you like those rocks
just as much as I do.

592
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,898
Say, lady.

593
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:45,896
Excuse me. We're a little mixed-up here.
Are we on the right road to Escudero?

594
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:47,989
This is Escudero.

595
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,568
- Is that the mountain?
- Is he still in there?

596
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:54,988
That's the mountain, and he's still in there.
Anything else you wanna know?

597
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,741
No. No, just stopping by
to take a look.

598
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:00,785
The name's Federber.
We're on our way to Bottomless Lake.

599
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:02,829
Gonna get in a week
of fishing and boating.

600
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:05,832
- Thought, as long as we're this close...
- Glad you dropped in, folks.

601
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:07,584
Uh, how'd you hear about it?

602
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:10,921
- Are you one of the family?
- No. Just a friend.

603
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:13,965
Well, haven't you seen the paper?
It's full of it.

604
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:16,801
- Got one?
- Sure. Picked one up in Albuquerque.

605
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:18,929
Come on, Nellie. Tilt.

606
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:20,421
Thanks.

607
00:40:20,773 --> 00:40:22,766
We thought there'd be
a lot of digging going on.

608
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:24,351
Where is everybody?

609
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:26,694
Scared of those Indian spooks, huh?

610
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:30,690
When are they gonna
start doing something?

611
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,528
Any minute now. They're on the way.
Aren't they, mister?

612
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:37,030
I guess it's all right
if we drive up there, isn't it?

613
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,615
Go ahead. Help yourself.

614
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:41,451
What do you say, Nellie?
Just a half an hour?

615
00:40:41,551 --> 00:40:44,996
All right. Later on,
we can have a nice breakfast here.

616
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:47,958
That is,
if it won't disturb the family.

617
00:40:48,058 --> 00:40:50,877
- It's all right. You can get breakfast.
- Thanks.

618
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:53,463
Wake up the kids, Nellie.
They should see this.

619
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:55,465
This is very instructive.

620
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:57,892
Walter, Willie, wake up.

621
00:41:11,657 --> 00:41:14,025
Say, you look pretty good here.

622
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,403
Wanna hear what I wrote about you?

623
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:18,697
"The grief-stricken wife
with a tear-stained face...

624
00:41:18,797 --> 00:41:22,033
trying to fight her way into the cave
to be at her husband's side."

625
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:25,620
Tough. You'll just have to rewrite me.

626
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,125
In a pig's eye. This is the way it reads best.
This is the way it's gonna be.

627
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:31,835
In tomorrow's paper
and the next day's.

628
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:34,879
It's the way people like it.
It's the way I'm gonna play it.

629
00:41:34,979 --> 00:41:36,715
Get this.

630
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:40,510
There's three of us buried here...
Leo, me and you.

631
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,846
We all wanna get out,
and we're going to.

632
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:47,309
Only I'm going back in style.
You can too, if you like.

633
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:49,444
Not with any 11 stinking dollars.

634
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,398
You saw those people.

635
00:41:53,498 --> 00:41:55,358
To you, they're
a couple of squares, huh?

636
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:59,362
To me, they're just the beginning.
To me, they're Mr. and Mrs. America.

637
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:01,448
I wasn't sure before, but now I know.

638
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:04,409
They're going for it. They'll eat it up...

639
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:07,078
the story and the hamburgers.

640
00:42:07,178 --> 00:42:10,540
You'll sell all your hamburgers,
hot dogs, soda pop...

641
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,335
and all your Navajo rugs.

642
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:17,555
There's gonna be real dough
in that cash register by tonight.

643
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:31,527
When they bleached your hair,
they must have bleached your brains too.

644
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:29,828
Hello there, Mr. Minosa.
Anything new with Leo?

645
00:43:29,928 --> 00:43:33,456
Not yet. Mr. Tatum's down there now
with the doctor.

646
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:34,556
Okay.

647
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:48,012
Hey! That'll be two bits.

648
00:43:48,112 --> 00:43:50,807
- It's the press.
- Twenty-five cents.

649
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:53,309
- Newspaper. We never pay.
- Everybody pays.

650
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:56,237
Mrs. Minosa says so.
Two bits.

651
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,324
Now keep movin'.

652
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,853
We'll have that air going
in about 20 minutes, Doctor.

653
00:44:36,953 --> 00:44:39,314
I could use a little of it myself.

654
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:42,901
- Thank you, Doctor.
- I'll send over some Aureomycine.

655
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:45,445
That's every four hours
for that one, isn't it?

656
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:49,032
Yes. The caffeine if he feels weak,
and the Demerol if the pain gets very bad.

657
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:50,575
- Yeah.
- Say, about every three hours.

658
00:44:50,675 --> 00:44:51,959
I got it.

659
00:44:52,085 --> 00:44:55,872
As soon as I can get close enough, I'll give him
a shot of tetanus-gas gangrene antitoxin.

660
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:59,542
But it's all right for the time being.
In fact, any time within a week.

661
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:02,462
But we'll have him out before then.

662
00:45:02,562 --> 00:45:04,055
Oh, sure.

663
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,682
Say, Doc.

664
00:45:07,684 --> 00:45:10,011
He's a pretty rugged customer, isn't he?

665
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:12,764
Leo? They don't come any tougher.

666
00:45:12,864 --> 00:45:14,849
He walked around
with a burst appendix for three days...

667
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:17,519
because he promised his wife
he'd take her to a square dance.

668
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:20,688
Well, as soon as you get him free,
I can start to work on him.

669
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,440
Call me anytime, night or day.

670
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,776
- I certainly will, Doctor. So long.
- Good-bye.

671
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:26,828
Thanks a lot.

672
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:34,244
It's a fine thing.
Now I have to pay to see you.

673
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:36,079
- Howdy, fan.
- You read the paper?

674
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:38,122
That I did.
Broke pretty good, huh?

675
00:45:38,222 --> 00:45:41,125
Boot flashed a couple hundred words over
the wires, and they came back for more.

676
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:43,086
- They want all we've got.
- Yeah, it figures.

677
00:45:43,186 --> 00:45:45,755
We wired all the art too.
What a break for me.

678
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,924
If this keeps up,
maybe Life will go for it or Look.

679
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:51,386
One of those four-page spreads.

680
00:45:51,486 --> 00:45:52,979
You like it now, don't ya?

681
00:45:53,814 --> 00:45:57,441
Well, everybody likes a break.
We didn't make it happen.

682
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,355
Oh, Smollett. How's it look?

683
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:04,440
Don't know yet. Lots of problems.

684
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,610
We've been figuring on doing
some bulkheading and cross-bracing.

685
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,697
But those old walls... I don't know.

686
00:46:10,797 --> 00:46:13,875
All right, boys.
Start bringing those jacks in.

687
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:16,794
Well, looks like
we'll be here for a while.

688
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,540
I brought you enough for a couple of days...
shirts and shorts. A couple of bottles.

689
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,710
Save it, fan. No booze.
Not for the duration.

690
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,602
Hey, you.

691
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:29,299
The sheriff wants to see you
down at the trading post.

692
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:32,510
And don't waste none of his time,
because he ain't staying around long.

693
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,013
- Maybe you ain't either.
- You don't say.

694
00:46:35,113 --> 00:46:37,640
You wanna know somethin'?
He don't like you.

695
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,610
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
And I was gonna propose to him.

696
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:56,159
He won't eat any steak.

697
00:46:56,259 --> 00:46:59,662
Maybe he'd like a little raw hamburger
or some milk maybe.

698
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:02,423
After all, he's only a baby.

699
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:06,594
Try him with a lollipop, Sheriff.

700
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:12,008
Or how about my right arm?

701
00:47:12,108 --> 00:47:14,344
He'd like that.

702
00:47:14,444 --> 00:47:16,054
You would too, wouldn't you?

703
00:47:16,154 --> 00:47:19,515
Oh, you're that Tatum guy that was
poppin' off over the phone last night.

704
00:47:19,615 --> 00:47:22,352
Not popping off, Sheriff.
Just threatening.

705
00:47:22,452 --> 00:47:24,812
You play along with me,
and I'll have you reelected.

706
00:47:24,912 --> 00:47:27,857
You don't, and I'll crucify you.
That's all I said. Remember?

707
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:31,986
I think I'll have my boys take you
to the county line and throw you out.

708
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:34,364
Throw out your campaign manager?

709
00:47:34,464 --> 00:47:36,032
You need plenty of help, Kretzer.

710
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:39,285
And maybe before I throw you out,
I'll toss you in the clink for a while.

711
00:47:39,385 --> 00:47:42,956
Wasting your time on a rattlesnake hunt.

712
00:47:43,056 --> 00:47:46,167
- This is where the votes are.
- What do you know about votes?

713
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:49,170
There's seven here in Escudero,
700 up there.

714
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:53,007
We had a big barbecue,
and I made a speech... a good one too.

715
00:47:53,107 --> 00:47:54,926
Then we sat down
to a little poker game...

716
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:57,595
and you started botherin' me...
right in the middle of a hand.

717
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:00,640
What'd you have, pair of deuces?

718
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,558
This is better.

719
00:48:02,658 --> 00:48:04,860
Here we've got an ace in the hole.

720
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:08,606
- I'll have a cup of coffee.
- Two candy bars, please.

721
00:48:08,706 --> 00:48:10,191
Couple hamburgers, please.

722
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:12,326
How much are those
Swiss cheese sandwiches?

723
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:17,281
Come on, Mama. I need some help.
We're swamped out here.

724
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,874
Come on.

725
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:27,083
Now, how's this, Sheriff? By tomorrow,
I'll have your name all over the paper...

726
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:31,087
the man who rushed here at the first cry
for help to direct the rescue operations.

727
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:33,715
By Tuesday, everyone
in the state will know ya.

728
00:48:33,815 --> 00:48:37,719
Gus Kretzer, the tireless public servant
who never spares himself.

729
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:40,346
I'll pile it on every day.

730
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:43,441
Six days of this,
and I'll make you a hero.

731
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:46,102
The election's in the bag.

732
00:48:46,202 --> 00:48:49,238
In the bag? The guys running
against you will vote for you.

733
00:48:50,574 --> 00:48:52,734
Okay, I'm a hero.

734
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:54,777
And what do I make you?

735
00:48:54,877 --> 00:48:56,746
Now here's the deal.

736
00:48:56,872 --> 00:49:00,742
The way things look, there's gonna be other
newspapermen trying to horn in on this story...

737
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:02,410
a lot of them.

738
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,545
Maybe all the way from New York.

739
00:49:06,089 --> 00:49:08,049
This is my story.

740
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:11,135
I wanna keep it mine.

741
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:14,221
You're gonna help me.

742
00:49:16,391 --> 00:49:18,676
Mr. Tatum,
we're moving you into our room.

743
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:20,428
It's a good, comfortable bed.

744
00:49:20,528 --> 00:49:23,097
Oh, no, Mr. Minosa.
I don't want to put anybody out.

745
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:26,142
Mama and I will be fine.
This is a great honor.

746
00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:27,769
Okay. Thanks.

747
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:30,146
Herbie, unpack for me, will ya?
And stand by.

748
00:49:30,246 --> 00:49:32,573
We're gonna take some pictures
of the sheriff.

749
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:39,155
Guess I'm getting too old
to crawl around in there.

750
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:41,532
- How about a cup of coffee?
- Make it two.

751
00:49:41,632 --> 00:49:43,625
Coming up.

752
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:46,003
- What's the latest?
- Not too good.

753
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:49,499
There must be a pretty deep fault underneath there
or it wouldn't have caved in.

754
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,042
How long will it take?

755
00:49:51,142 --> 00:49:53,503
Of course, we haven't been able
to get all the way back.

756
00:49:53,603 --> 00:49:55,588
There's a lot of shoring to do first.

757
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:58,633
That means getting
those bulkhead timbers placed right.

758
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:01,469
- Then there's all that cross-bracing.
- How long?

759
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:04,097
When we get that done,
we oughta be able to start operating...

760
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:06,057
moving those heavy slabs and stones...

761
00:50:06,157 --> 00:50:09,352
so the whole shebang doesn't
come crashing in on us... and on him.

762
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:13,606
- How long?
- Well, Gus, I can't tell you exactly.

763
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:16,742
But I don't see how we can do it
under 16 hours.

764
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:19,903
Uh-uh.

765
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:25,368
Well, maybe I can do it in 12 hours
if I send for a second crew.

766
00:50:25,468 --> 00:50:29,046
Although some of the men don't want to work
on account of that jinx you wrote about.

767
00:50:31,967 --> 00:50:34,836
Look, Mr. Smollett,
I'm no engineer...

768
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:36,921
but the way you wanna do it...

769
00:50:37,021 --> 00:50:40,633
those crumbling walls
and piles of stones...

770
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:43,177
Isn't that kinda dangerous
for your men?

771
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:46,430
Not after we get the walls braced.

772
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,309
Suppose we set up a drill
on top of the mountain...

773
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,478
and go straight down.

774
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:55,565
Cut through all that rock?

775
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:57,775
Do you know how long
that would take?

776
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:59,652
You tell me.

777
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:02,280
Six, maybe seven days.

778
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,824
It's a great big job.

779
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:06,784
Have you got any drills like that?

780
00:51:06,884 --> 00:51:09,912
Yes, sir, but it's not necessary.

781
00:51:10,012 --> 00:51:12,915
Once we get that back part
shored up, I think...

782
00:51:13,015 --> 00:51:16,210
You're thinking too much.
Let Mr. Tatum do the thinkin'.

783
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,504
But he's all wrong. I think...

784
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:20,381
You're thinkin' again, Sam.

785
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:22,592
A few years ago,
you was a truck driver.

786
00:51:22,692 --> 00:51:24,802
Now that I'm sheriff,
you're a contractor.

787
00:51:24,902 --> 00:51:27,730
Do you want to
be a truck driver again?

788
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:31,058
All right, Gus.

789
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:34,645
If that's the way you want it,
I'll... I'll set the drill.

790
00:51:34,745 --> 00:51:39,366
But that fellow in there...
seven days.

791
00:51:40,493 --> 00:51:43,529
I know what's in your mind, Mr. Smollett,
and it does you credit.

792
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:47,450
Leo's a rugged boy.
The doctor told me that himself.

793
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,003
And he'll get the best of care,
so don't worry.

794
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:53,539
Sugar?

795
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:56,834
- How about some cigarettes?
- Couple of hot dogs, please.

796
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:59,629
Don't you wanna be paid, lady?
We had four hamburgers and four coffees.

797
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:02,223
- That's 1 .20.
- Can you change a 50?

798
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:14,860
- Hey, how about one here, Chuck?
- Okay, fan.

799
00:52:19,908 --> 00:52:21,525
Get me a few of Mr. Smollett...

800
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,154
the man whose know-how
is gonna save the life of Leo Minosa.

801
00:52:25,254 --> 00:52:28,165
You'll be the biggest contractor
in the business, I betcha.

802
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:31,160
Now let's get that drill.

803
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,754
See ya, gentlemen.
Lot of work to do.

804
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:16,964
Yes?

805
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:21,510
Come on, come on. What is it?

806
00:53:22,971 --> 00:53:27,425
I met a lot of hard-boiled eggs
in my life, but you...

807
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:29,518
You're 20 minutes.

808
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:34,140
Is that a boost or a knock?
Because I haven't time to figure it out.

809
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,183
I've been doing my own figuring.

810
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:40,354
Took in 70 bucks so far.
By tonight, it oughta be 150.

811
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:43,991
Seven times a hundred and fif...
That's over a grand.

812
00:53:45,994 --> 00:53:48,495
That's the first grand I ever had.

813
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:51,356
Thanks.

814
00:53:53,335 --> 00:53:55,002
Thanks a lot.

815
00:53:57,672 --> 00:54:02,501
Look, Mrs. Minosa,
your husband's stuck under a mountain.

816
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:06,513
You're worried sick.
That's the way the story goes.

817
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,426
Now get the smile off your face.

818
00:54:10,526 --> 00:54:13,179
It's been a nice day, Chuck.

819
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:16,899
- I feel like smiling.
- You heard me. Get it off.

820
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,321
Make me.

821
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:28,285
That's more like it.

822
00:54:30,288 --> 00:54:34,408
And don't wipe those tears.
That's the way you're supposed to look.

823
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:36,786
Put on your wedding ring.

824
00:54:36,886 --> 00:54:39,380
Go on back
and peddle your hamburgers.

825
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:07,149
Good morning, everybody.
This is radio station KOAT, Albuquerque.

826
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:09,777
Bob Bumpas speaking and bringing you
another on-the-spot report...

827
00:55:09,877 --> 00:55:11,821
of the Leo Minosa rescue operation.

828
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:13,906
- Send up more casings!
- Since the operation began three days ago...

829
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:16,617
the drill has cut its way
57 feet closer to Leo.

830
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,369
You have just heard the voice
of Sam Smollett...

831
00:55:18,469 --> 00:55:20,329
the man who is in charge
of the drilling job.

832
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:23,999
This man, together with Sheriff Kretzer
and a crew of volunteer rescue workers...

833
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:27,711
is tirelessly fighting this battle
against stubborn rock and fleeting time...

834
00:55:27,811 --> 00:55:29,672
with a human life at stake.

835
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:31,507
If anyone can lick this...

836
00:55:31,607 --> 00:55:34,552
this curse of the Mountain of
the Seven Vultures... they can.

837
00:55:34,652 --> 00:55:37,221
Ladies and gentlemen,
something phenomenal is going on here...

838
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:39,723
right in front of
this 400-year-old cliff dwelling.

839
00:55:39,823 --> 00:55:41,517
A new community is springing up...

840
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:44,770
a veritable town of tents
and trucks and trailers.

841
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:46,730
Standing here,
I can pick out license plates...

842
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,525
from California, Arizona,
Texas and Oklahoma.

843
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:51,569
And more cars pouring in
all the time.

844
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:53,946
And more volunteer workers
from all over the state.

845
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:57,283
Top-flight newspapermen from
the biggest papers in the country are here.

846
00:55:57,383 --> 00:56:00,369
The most outstanding of these newspaper
people is, of course, Chuck Tatum...

847
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:03,581
the courageous reporter who first
made contact with Leo last Saturday.

848
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:07,126
Later on in this broadcast, we will try
to get Mr. Tatum to this microphone.

849
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:09,795
In the meantime, I'm sure you'll
want to hear from some of the folks...

850
00:56:09,895 --> 00:56:12,131
who have gathered here to hope
and pray for Leo's rescue.

851
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:14,133
This gentleman right here...
What is your name, sir?

852
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:15,885
Uh, Federber. Al Federber.

853
00:56:15,985 --> 00:56:17,887
What business are you in,
Mr. Federber?

854
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:19,889
In the insurance game, in Gallup.

855
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:22,516
Feel right at home, Mr. Federber.
Speak right into the microphone, please.

856
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:25,478
Uh, we're from Gallup.

857
00:56:25,578 --> 00:56:27,605
This is Mrs. Federber and the boys.

858
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:31,358
It's a very wonderful thing to see a man and
his family come all the way from Gallup...

859
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:33,402
to join us here
during these anxious days.

860
00:56:33,502 --> 00:56:35,571
Well, I didn't exactly
what you call join.

861
00:56:35,671 --> 00:56:38,657
I heard you talkin' to some
other people on the radio last night.

862
00:56:38,757 --> 00:56:40,743
We were over there
in our trailer having supper.

863
00:56:40,843 --> 00:56:42,995
And they said they were
the first ones here.

864
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:46,499
Oh, I hate to call anybody a liar,
but that just plain isn't so.

865
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:48,501
My wife will bear me out.

866
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:51,921
Nellie, who were the first
people here? Tell them.

867
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:55,382
Why, we were. I wouldn't lie
about a thing like that.

868
00:56:55,482 --> 00:56:57,218
I'm sure you wouldn't,
Mrs. Federber.

869
00:56:57,318 --> 00:57:01,138
Now, Mr. Federber, what is your reaction
to this wonderful job being done here?

870
00:57:01,238 --> 00:57:03,265
I think it's wonderful.

871
00:57:03,365 --> 00:57:06,310
I run up against accidents all the time.
I know what I'm talkin' about.

872
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:08,312
I'm in the insurance game myself.

873
00:57:08,412 --> 00:57:11,565
You never can tell when
an accident's gonna happen.

874
00:57:11,665 --> 00:57:15,528
I sure hope Leo had the good sense
to provide for an emergency like this.

875
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:17,947
Now, you take my outfit...
the Pacific All-Risk.

876
00:57:18,047 --> 00:57:19,990
- We have a little policy that covers...
- Thank you.

877
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,825
Thank you very much,
Mr. Federber.

878
00:57:21,925 --> 00:57:23,953
I'm sorry we have to interrupt
these on-the-spot interviews...

879
00:57:24,053 --> 00:57:27,289
but I see it's almost time for Mr. Tatum
to make his first visit of the day to Leo.

880
00:57:27,389 --> 00:57:30,626
Stand by while we move our
microphone closer to the cliff dwelling.

881
00:57:30,726 --> 00:57:34,171
We'll try to get Mr. Tatum to say
a few words to you when he reaches us.

882
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,265
In the meantime...

883
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:41,937
Hold it, fan.

884
00:57:54,534 --> 00:57:58,112
Look, Mrs. Minosa, they're having
a rosary at that little church this evening.

885
00:57:58,212 --> 00:57:59,655
I want you to be there.

886
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:03,909
I don't go to church.
Kneeling bags my nylons.

887
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:06,211
You're makin' enough dough
to buy yourself another pair.

888
00:58:06,337 --> 00:58:10,082
I want you to be there because I'm sending Herbie
down to get a couple of shots. Understand?

889
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:11,182
Okay.

890
00:58:12,176 --> 00:58:15,921
But only because you wrote me up
so pretty in today's paper.

891
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:18,424
You sure can make with the words.

892
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:20,509
"A figure of fair-haired loveliness...

893
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:22,845
in the lengthening shadow
of the cursed mountain..."

894
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:24,537
Unquote.

895
00:58:24,939 --> 00:58:29,268
Tomorrow this'll be yesterday's paper
and they'll wrap a fish in it.

896
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:33,113
And another thing, mister.
Don't ever slap me again.

897
00:58:57,889 --> 00:58:59,798
Did you buy the cigars for Leo?

898
00:58:59,898 --> 00:59:02,885
Real Havana. The best
I could find in Albuquerque.

899
00:59:02,985 --> 00:59:06,472
I got a job for you, fan.
Pick up Mrs. Minosa... Lorraine, I mean.

900
00:59:06,572 --> 00:59:08,932
Make sure she gets
to that church this evening.

901
00:59:09,032 --> 00:59:11,143
I want a picture of her
with her beads.

902
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:13,854
- If she hasn't got any, get some for her.
- Sure.

903
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:16,190
And how about me taking a picture
of a medicine man...

904
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,359
you know, with the fancy headdress
and all the trimmings...

905
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:19,902
exorcising all the evil spirits?

906
00:59:20,002 --> 00:59:21,820
Now you're clicking, fan.

907
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,822
- That's got a message.
- Thanks.

908
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:26,450
- When I take your copy into Albuquerque...
- No more copy.

909
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:31,246
Not for Boot anyhow. As of now, I'm not
working for the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin.

910
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:34,166
- Neither are you. We quit.
- Both of us?

911
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:37,461
- Hope it's all right with you.
- Sure, Chuck.

912
00:59:37,561 --> 00:59:40,255
There isn't anything you could
do wrong as far as I'm concerned.

913
00:59:40,355 --> 00:59:41,757
But I don't get it.

914
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:44,176
Quit in the middle of a story
right when it's snowballing like this?

915
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:46,595
That's exactly the time to do it,
Herbie boy.

916
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:48,597
They've been lapping it up,
every word...

917
00:59:48,697 --> 00:59:51,392
every paper
from New York to Los Angeles.

918
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:55,479
So now we turn off the spigot.
Just like that.

919
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:57,606
Watch them
with their tongues out.

920
00:59:57,706 --> 01:00:01,777
Stop at that tent.
Let's see the gentlemen of the press.

921
01:00:01,877 --> 01:00:04,613
Look, boys, I don't care
where you come from...

922
01:00:04,713 --> 01:00:07,991
New York, Philadelphia,
Chicago or the moon.

923
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:09,827
Nobody goes down to see Leo.

924
01:00:09,927 --> 01:00:12,454
- What about Tatum?
- It's out of bounds.

925
01:00:12,554 --> 01:00:14,998
- Why?
- Because it's dangerous down there.

926
01:00:15,098 --> 01:00:17,042
Because a wall could fall in on you.

927
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:20,170
Because I'm sheriff and because
I'm responsible for everybody's safety.

928
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,048
- What about Tatum?
- Out of bounds. You heard me!

929
01:00:23,148 --> 01:00:25,300
What about Tatum?

930
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,302
You're repeatin' yourself.

931
01:00:27,402 --> 01:00:31,306
This is a pretty nice place
I fixed up here for you boys.

932
01:00:31,406 --> 01:00:34,435
Be a shame to cut all these wires
and kick you out.

933
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:35,978
Don't try it, Mr. Sheriff.

934
01:00:36,078 --> 01:00:39,231
We wouldn't take that kind of guff
from J. Edgar Hoover, let alone from you.

935
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:42,317
We came all the way out here
to do a job, and we're going to do it.

936
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:45,821
- It's out of bounds!
- Now you're repeating yourself.

937
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:47,573
How come it isn't
out of bounds for Tatum?

938
01:00:47,673 --> 01:00:51,285
How come he goes in as much
as he wants to? What about Tatum?

939
01:00:51,385 --> 01:00:53,871
That's right.
What about Tatum?

940
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:55,873
Howdy, fans.

941
01:00:55,973 --> 01:00:58,592
Why, it's like old home week.

942
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:02,212
Glad to see you, Mac.

943
01:01:02,312 --> 01:01:04,798
Mr. McCardle. Used to work
together in New York.

944
01:01:04,898 --> 01:01:08,385
And if it isn't Jessop...
big-hearted Mickey Jessop.

945
01:01:08,485 --> 01:01:11,054
Thanks for the 50 bucks
you didn't send me.

946
01:01:11,154 --> 01:01:14,016
Guess he didn't get my wire.

947
01:01:14,116 --> 01:01:16,643
And what do you know?
Josh Morgan. Where was it?

948
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:19,396
Boston? Chicago?
All I know is, he's got a hernia.

949
01:01:19,496 --> 01:01:22,649
Sittin' pretty, aren't you, Chuck?
Got everything sewed up... Leo, the sheriff.

950
01:01:22,749 --> 01:01:25,778
Try to talk to the father, the mother,
the wife, and what do we get?

951
01:01:25,878 --> 01:01:29,364
- "See Tatum! See Tatum!"
- He's a friend of the family.

952
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:32,201
Now, what's your beef, fans?
You're smart cookies.

953
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:34,787
Big-city newspapermen.

954
01:01:34,887 --> 01:01:38,081
There's a lot of good stories
lying around here, all yours.

955
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:41,126
The weather, the crowds, the Indians.

956
01:01:41,226 --> 01:01:44,546
Inside stuff...
how they weave a rug.

957
01:01:44,646 --> 01:01:48,050
Cut it out, Chuck. We're all buddies.
We're all in the same boat.

958
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,894
I'm in the boat.
You're in the water.

959
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:56,441
Now let's see you swim, buddies.

960
01:01:57,485 --> 01:02:00,020
Tatum, I always knew you were a louse.

961
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,147
Easy, Mr. Morgan.

962
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:05,359
You're talking to an officer of the law.

963
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:07,277
That tin badge
will do you no good.

964
01:02:07,377 --> 01:02:09,112
We've launched a protest
with your publisher.

965
01:02:09,212 --> 01:02:11,114
Launch it with the sheriff.
He's my superior.

966
01:02:11,214 --> 01:02:14,993
We'll take this all the way to Santa Fe,
to the governor. You know what he'll do.

967
01:02:15,093 --> 01:02:18,747
You bet I do. He's a fine man, and
he'll take action. He'll phone the sheriff.

968
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:21,416
And I'll write him a letter
and tell him I'm doin' my duty.

969
01:02:21,516 --> 01:02:24,086
Then you talk to the governor again,
and he'll talk to the attorney general.

970
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:26,964
And for all I know,
they'll throw me out of here.

971
01:02:27,064 --> 01:02:30,050
Only by that time, buddies,
Leo will be out...

972
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:33,520
and the story is finished...
over, done!

973
01:02:34,689 --> 01:02:36,765
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I got a date with Leo.

974
01:02:36,865 --> 01:02:39,935
Popcorn! Popcorn! Only 10 cents!

975
01:02:40,035 --> 01:02:43,146
Just so you don't think
I'm a complete louse...

976
01:02:43,246 --> 01:02:46,608
I do have some news for you.

977
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,610
Put it on a Teletype.

978
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,446
Tell your papers Chuck Tatum is available.

979
01:02:51,546 --> 01:02:54,533
Looks like there's gonna be three
or four more days of hot copy.

980
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:57,043
Exclusive.
And Tatum is sitting on it.

981
01:02:58,713 --> 01:03:01,047
So let's hear their bids.

982
01:03:03,175 --> 01:03:05,343
Come on, fan.

983
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:17,939
"Reelect Sheriff Kretzer."

984
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:28,483
Of course, it's hard to say
what we might run into.

985
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:31,320
You hit rock
and then those layers of shale.

986
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,989
That's what we call a stratified formation...

987
01:03:34,089 --> 01:03:36,325
- and that means changing the bit...
- Wait just a second!

988
01:03:36,425 --> 01:03:38,869
There's Mr. Tatum making his way
toward the cliff dwelling.

989
01:03:38,969 --> 01:03:41,296
I'm going to try to get him
on this microphone.

990
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:46,801
Mr. Tatum! Mr. Tatum!

991
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,380
Good. He's coming
over this way now.

992
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,591
Mr. Tatum, could you spare us
a few moments, please?

993
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:55,969
Just a word or two about Leo and the way
things look to you down there.

994
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:58,138
Well, we're making progress,
good progress.

995
01:03:58,238 --> 01:04:00,515
But every second counts
in this rescue operation.

996
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:02,768
And I'm sure your radio audience
will excuse me...

997
01:04:02,868 --> 01:04:06,355
as well as Mr. Smollett here
if he goes back to his post at the drill.

998
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:08,815
I don't know why they
have to use a drill at all.

999
01:04:08,915 --> 01:04:10,817
They don't have to go from the top.

1000
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:12,903
There's a quicker way
to get that man out of there.

1001
01:04:13,003 --> 01:04:15,364
- What's your name, sir?
- My name is Kusak.

1002
01:04:15,464 --> 01:04:17,366
I did a lot of mining in my day...

1003
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:19,993
silver mining, that is...
up in Virginia City.

1004
01:04:20,093 --> 01:04:21,995
Now, the way I see it...

1005
01:04:22,095 --> 01:04:24,081
Yes, go ahead, Mr. Kusak.
We're very much interested.

1006
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:26,750
Well, we had cave-ins...
quite a few of them.

1007
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:29,378
One that I know of
was further in than yours.

1008
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:32,047
Were you ever in a cave-in
yourself, Mr. Kusak?

1009
01:04:32,147 --> 01:04:33,799
No, not personally.

1010
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:36,468
Well, I was. Course, you might not
call it a cave-in exactly...

1011
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:38,470
but I was stuck in an elevator once...

1012
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,056
in the store I work in, between
the basement and the subbasement.

1013
01:04:41,156 --> 01:04:43,100
It was six hours
before they could get me out...

1014
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,185
and they had to use
a blowtorch to do it.

1015
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:47,646
Right from the top.
Just like here.

1016
01:04:47,746 --> 01:04:50,482
I'm afraid I gotta be
getting back to my crew.

1017
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:55,237
As I was trying to say, we didn't
have no big drill. We didn't need it.

1018
01:04:55,337 --> 01:04:58,657
We just hauled in the timber and
shored up the walls all the way back.

1019
01:04:58,757 --> 01:05:02,452
Now, if we did it that way in Virginia City,
why can't we do it that way here?

1020
01:05:02,552 --> 01:05:04,913
Aw, you're not telling me
anything I don't know.

1021
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:07,499
I know all about
shoring and bracing.

1022
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,503
Mr. Kusak, you see, this is a cliff
dwelling and not a silver mine.

1023
01:05:11,603 --> 01:05:15,849
Well, I think it's all the same. A man's
underground, and you got to get him out.

1024
01:05:17,309 --> 01:05:19,352
Did you get your man out, Mr. Kusak?

1025
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:22,355
I'm afraid we didn't.
We were too late.

1026
01:05:23,941 --> 01:05:28,937
Well then, suppose we let Mr. Smollett
do it his way... from the top.

1027
01:05:29,037 --> 01:05:30,897
Thank you, Mr. Tatum.
Thank you very much.

1028
01:05:30,997 --> 01:05:32,566
And thank you, Mr. Smollett.

1029
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,735
I know I speak for
my entire radio audience...

1030
01:05:34,835 --> 01:05:37,029
when I express my great
admiration for both of you.

1031
01:05:37,129 --> 01:05:38,780
Mr. Tatum is now
approaching the entrance...

1032
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,158
to the cliff dwelling to start another one
of his perilous journeys...

1033
01:05:41,258 --> 01:05:43,994
into the underground mazes
of this dread mountain.

1034
01:05:44,094 --> 01:05:48,214
As he waves to the crowd,
you can hear the tremendous cheer!

1035
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:08,310
Hiya, Leo. What do you say?

1036
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:10,312
Five minutes late this morning.

1037
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:13,106
Sorry. What's the matter?

1038
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:16,151
- Did you eat anything?
- I'm not hungry.

1039
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:18,487
- Take your pills?
- Yeah.

1040
01:06:18,587 --> 01:06:21,406
This afternoon, when the doctor comes,
you better give yourself another injection.

1041
01:06:21,506 --> 01:06:24,159
I don't want any injection.
It's that drill.

1042
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:27,079
You gotta keep telling yourself, Leo,
they're getting closer all the time.

1043
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:29,206
I can't stand it.
It never stops.

1044
01:06:29,306 --> 01:06:32,292
It's like somebody was drivin'
crooked nails through my head!

1045
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:35,212
Listen to it! It's enough
to wake up the dead, I tell you!

1046
01:06:35,312 --> 01:06:36,904
Stop it!

1047
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,600
I'm sorry.

1048
01:06:42,686 --> 01:06:46,523
Here. I brought you the paper.

1049
01:06:47,983 --> 01:06:49,383
Thanks.

1050
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:52,270
Yesterday, I read there were
2,000 people outside.

1051
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,481
Today there's over 3,000.

1052
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:56,525
Well, who are they?
What do they want?

1053
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:59,494
- They're your friends.
- They are?

1054
01:07:00,412 --> 01:07:03,865
I guess everybody's got a lot of friends
they don't even know about.

1055
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:05,909
Like those guys drillin' for me.

1056
01:07:06,009 --> 01:07:10,163
Or like you, Chuck. I didn't even know
you were alive this time last week.

1057
01:07:10,263 --> 01:07:12,207
And now you're my friend.

1058
01:07:12,307 --> 01:07:14,300
I guess you're my best friend.

1059
01:07:16,137 --> 01:07:20,340
Leo, when we get you out of here...

1060
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,634
I'll be goin' to New York,
more than likely.

1061
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,803
Then I won't be
seein' you anymore?

1062
01:07:24,903 --> 01:07:28,932
No. I was just about to say,
when I'm in New York...

1063
01:07:29,032 --> 01:07:32,769
I'll bring you out to visit me for a couple
of weeks... or as long as you want.

1064
01:07:32,869 --> 01:07:34,771
Stay right with me.

1065
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:37,232
Hey, you ever been in New York?

1066
01:07:37,332 --> 01:07:40,527
Been in Baltimore. Never New York.

1067
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:42,737
We're really gonna have a great time.
You'll see.

1068
01:07:42,837 --> 01:07:44,573
We'll live it up a little.

1069
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:48,209
New York. Lorraine told me
a lot about New York.

1070
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:51,671
Does she talk about me?
Is she upset?

1071
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:55,417
Sure. Everybody's upset about you.

1072
01:07:55,517 --> 01:07:58,587
- Say, Chuck, what day is this?
- Wednesday.

1073
01:07:58,687 --> 01:08:01,089
Think there's a chance
they can get me out by Friday?

1074
01:08:01,189 --> 01:08:04,092
- Because Friday's somethin' special.
- We're doing all we can.

1075
01:08:04,192 --> 01:08:07,437
Because it's gonna be five years
that Lorraine and I were married.

1076
01:08:09,356 --> 01:08:12,100
You know, things haven't
been so good between us.

1077
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,352
Maybe this'll make a difference.

1078
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:16,897
Maybe we can start all over again.

1079
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:20,283
Maybe I can take her along
on that trip to New York.

1080
01:08:23,495 --> 01:08:25,496
She's so pretty.

1081
01:08:31,545 --> 01:08:33,747
Here you are! Get yourself a red hot!

1082
01:08:33,847 --> 01:08:35,924
A show-stoppin' monster for a dime!

1083
01:08:39,887 --> 01:08:42,464
We can't let them come in here,
Lorraine! Not the carnival!

1084
01:08:42,564 --> 01:08:44,257
Quiet, Papa.
I told them it was all right.

1085
01:08:44,357 --> 01:08:46,218
It is not all right.
I won't have them here.

1086
01:08:46,318 --> 01:08:48,678
They're paying for it.
Good money.

1087
01:08:48,778 --> 01:08:52,307
Look at them. Selling balloons here,
ice cream, hot dogs.

1088
01:08:52,407 --> 01:08:54,643
Everybody's paying for it.

1089
01:08:54,743 --> 01:08:57,562
Why don't we just lock up this place
and tell everybody to go home?

1090
01:08:57,662 --> 01:08:59,147
Because they won't go home.

1091
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:02,108
They'll just park on the other side of
the highway and eat someplace else.

1092
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:03,818
Why shouldn't we
get something out of it?

1093
01:09:03,918 --> 01:09:06,655
I don't want their money.
All I want is Leo.

1094
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:09,699
Who do you think the money's for?
It's for him when he gets out.

1095
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:12,077
He's always wanted to make
some improvements around here...

1096
01:09:12,177 --> 01:09:13,787
build some cabins for tourists...

1097
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:16,248
buy a new car,
have a little money in the bank.

1098
01:09:16,348 --> 01:09:19,550
It'll make things easier for him.
Doesn't that make sense, Papa?

1099
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:26,431
Mr. Tatum!

1100
01:09:28,894 --> 01:09:31,721
- How is he?
- Pretty good.

1101
01:09:31,821 --> 01:09:34,891
Does it hurt him bad?
Is he getting any sleep?

1102
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:36,726
Sure, he's fine.

1103
01:09:36,826 --> 01:09:39,437
Well, you ought to see him...
smoking a cigar, reading the paper.

1104
01:09:39,537 --> 01:09:41,439
He's making plans.

1105
01:09:41,539 --> 01:09:45,026
All the doctor says is he's doing
as well as can be expected.

1106
01:09:45,126 --> 01:09:48,613
- What does that mean?
- Means he's gonna be fine.

1107
01:09:48,713 --> 01:09:52,125
Means everything's gonna be fine,
doesn't it, Mr. Tatum?

1108
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:11,144
How is he, mister? Did you see him?

1109
01:10:12,521 --> 01:10:14,723
- Is he holding out?
- Is he all right?

1110
01:10:14,823 --> 01:10:16,224
What did he have to say?

1111
01:10:16,324 --> 01:10:18,818
When do you think
they'll get him out?

1112
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:44,052
Go ahead.
I guess you need a drink.

1113
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:50,808
Care to join me?

1114
01:10:51,852 --> 01:10:55,305
Looks like the only other glass we have
is one of these candle jiggers.

1115
01:10:55,405 --> 01:10:57,599
Sensational copy
you've been sending in.

1116
01:10:57,699 --> 01:11:00,477
- Glad you like it.
- Had to get out an extra every day.

1117
01:11:00,577 --> 01:11:02,687
Circulation jumped 8,000.

1118
01:11:02,787 --> 01:11:05,398
What'd you come down for?
To pin a medal on me?

1119
01:11:05,498 --> 01:11:09,243
You've got a medal.
And I know how you got it.

1120
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,116
What else do you know?

1121
01:11:15,216 --> 01:11:18,578
Heard a few things in Albuquerque
about how you're handling this story.

1122
01:11:18,678 --> 01:11:20,121
I didn't like it.

1123
01:11:20,221 --> 01:11:22,340
Now that I'm here,
I like it even less.

1124
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:25,460
Suppose you stop
beating around the bush.

1125
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,380
Tatum, you've been putting a halo
around that Kretzer sheriff...

1126
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,382
so you could hog the whole story.

1127
01:11:30,482 --> 01:11:33,218
That's the setup, isn't it?

1128
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:35,970
Oh. For a minute,
you had me scared.

1129
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:38,139
I thought I did something real bad.

1130
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,142
You have. Kretzer should
be kicked out, not reelected.

1131
01:11:41,242 --> 01:11:43,728
One of these days,
I'll get the facts and print them.

1132
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:47,148
I think he's corrupt, rotten, no good.

1133
01:11:47,248 --> 01:11:49,192
He's been good to me.

1134
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:51,986
So there'll be one more crooked
sheriff in the world. Who cares?

1135
01:11:52,086 --> 01:11:55,448
I do. I don't make deals...
not my paper...

1136
01:11:55,548 --> 01:11:57,750
even if it does sell
8,000 more a day.

1137
01:12:01,255 --> 01:12:04,382
Hello. Who in Chicago?

1138
01:12:05,884 --> 01:12:08,845
Tell them Mr. Tatum'll be ready
to talk in half an hour.

1139
01:12:10,639 --> 01:12:12,674
Now then, Mr. Boot,
I sent you a wire this morning.

1140
01:12:12,774 --> 01:12:14,592
- Apparently you didn't get it.
- No, I didn't.

1141
01:12:14,692 --> 01:12:18,805
Because you could have
saved yourself the trip. I've quit.

1142
01:12:18,905 --> 01:12:21,274
I'm not working for you anymore.

1143
01:12:22,192 --> 01:12:24,686
I'm sorry to hear that, Chuck.

1144
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:27,689
No, you're not. I'm not
your kind of newspaperman.

1145
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:29,315
I don't belong in your office...

1146
01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:32,527
not with that embroidered
sign on the wall.

1147
01:12:32,627 --> 01:12:34,529
It gets in my way.

1148
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:36,531
Then it does bother you a little.

1149
01:12:36,631 --> 01:12:37,949
Not enough to stop me.

1150
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:41,453
I'm on my way, and if it takes a deal with
a crooked sheriff, that's all right with me.

1151
01:12:41,553 --> 01:12:43,371
And if I have to fancy it up
with an Indian curse...

1152
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:45,665
and a brokenhearted wife for Leo,
that's all right too!

1153
01:12:45,765 --> 01:12:49,419
Not with me, it isn't. And not with
a lot of others in this business.

1154
01:12:49,519 --> 01:12:52,046
Phony, below the belt journalism.
That's what it is.

1155
01:12:52,146 --> 01:12:55,550
Not below the belt.
Right in the gut, Mr. Boot.

1156
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:58,219
- Human interest.
- You heard me. Phony.

1157
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:01,347
For all I know, there isn't
even a Leo down there.

1158
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:05,151
Yes, there is.
Tatum made sure of that.

1159
01:13:08,614 --> 01:13:12,108
Look, I've waited a long time
for my turn at bat.

1160
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:14,402
Now that they've
pitched me a fat one...

1161
01:13:14,502 --> 01:13:17,413
I'm gonna smack it
right out of the ballpark.

1162
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,337
Yes? What paper?

1163
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:28,508
Tell Philadelphia to call back
in half an hour.

1164
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:31,836
You know what, Chuck?

1165
01:13:31,936 --> 01:13:35,014
I had that medicine man
stage a whole ceremonial.

1166
01:13:36,433 --> 01:13:38,184
Hello, Mr. Boot.

1167
01:13:39,228 --> 01:13:41,638
Come on, Herbie. Get your things
together. We're going back.

1168
01:13:41,738 --> 01:13:45,483
Tatum just hit a home run,
and the big leagues are calling.

1169
01:13:47,027 --> 01:13:50,530
Go ahead, Herbie. Maybe Boot's right.
Maybe you better go back with him.

1170
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,608
But you said I could stick with you.

1171
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:57,278
Give him good advice, Chuck.
You can do it.

1172
01:13:57,378 --> 01:13:59,739
He's old enough
to make up his own mind.

1173
01:13:59,839 --> 01:14:02,617
Everybody in this game
has to make up his own mind.

1174
01:14:02,717 --> 01:14:05,954
I've made up mine.

1175
01:14:06,054 --> 01:14:08,047
Hello. Yes?

1176
01:14:10,384 --> 01:14:14,428
Sure, I'm ready to talk
to New York. Put 'em on.

1177
01:14:19,017 --> 01:14:20,969
Don't be so sorry for him.

1178
01:14:21,069 --> 01:14:23,054
What makes you think
the Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin...

1179
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:24,806
is all that a kid wants out of life?

1180
01:14:24,906 --> 01:14:27,725
What makes you think
you have all the answers?

1181
01:14:27,825 --> 01:14:31,104
They're out of date...
high-button shoes, belt and suspenders.

1182
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:33,147
They're not wearing them anymore.

1183
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:36,985
Look at the calendar, Mr. Boot.
It's the 20th century. The second half of it.

1184
01:14:37,085 --> 01:14:40,663
You don't expect the kid to stand still.
He wants to get going. Going!

1185
01:14:41,665 --> 01:14:43,666
Going where?

1186
01:14:52,342 --> 01:14:54,542
Hello. Who?

1187
01:14:55,929 --> 01:14:59,215
Mr. Nagel?
Not lover boy himself!

1188
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:01,342
Well, well.

1189
01:15:01,442 --> 01:15:04,679
Tell me, Mr. Nagel, did you ever
repair that ceiling in your office?

1190
01:15:04,779 --> 01:15:08,433
The one you hit the day you told me
my services were no longer required.

1191
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:11,561
All right, Tatum.
You're a very comical guy.

1192
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:13,646
And I promise
I'm gonna laugh... hard!

1193
01:15:13,746 --> 01:15:17,358
But not right now.
What about that Minosa story?

1194
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:20,445
Yes, the weather's fine in New York.

1195
01:15:20,545 --> 01:15:24,699
No, it's not raining.
Yes, she's still here.

1196
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:29,287
Come on, Tatum. How much
for the Minosa story? Exclusive!

1197
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:32,665
What? Don't you know
there's a war on... somewhere?

1198
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:34,709
I'll give you a thousand dollars.

1199
01:15:34,809 --> 01:15:38,588
What do you think I got here,
a plane crash or a set of quadruplets?

1200
01:15:38,688 --> 01:15:41,015
This is a circulation builder.

1201
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,387
It'll go another four days.

1202
01:15:46,487 --> 01:15:48,481
Some beautiful copy coming.

1203
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:52,935
Speak up fast.
There's a waiting list.

1204
01:15:53,035 --> 01:15:55,063
So you think you've got me
over a barrel.

1205
01:15:55,163 --> 01:15:56,773
All right, maybe you have!

1206
01:15:56,873 --> 01:15:59,776
Give you a thousand a day,
as long as it lasts.

1207
01:15:59,876 --> 01:16:03,037
Mr. Nagel, you're not getting the point.

1208
01:16:04,623 --> 01:16:06,908
It's not just a thousand a day.

1209
01:16:07,008 --> 01:16:10,787
It's that desk of mine I want back
when this is over.

1210
01:16:10,887 --> 01:16:14,874
You heard me.
The old desk, the old job.

1211
01:16:14,974 --> 01:16:17,843
Here, here, lover boy,
watch that ceiling.

1212
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:22,674
That's more like it.

1213
01:16:22,774 --> 01:16:24,676
Now put the contract
on the wires.

1214
01:16:24,776 --> 01:16:26,928
You get the first story in an hour.

1215
01:16:27,028 --> 01:16:30,348
Oh, one more thing.

1216
01:16:30,448 --> 01:16:33,101
See that there's some
flowers on my desk...

1217
01:16:33,201 --> 01:16:36,654
with a little ribbon...
"Welcome home."

1218
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:44,404
This means you too, fan.
We're rounding third.

1219
01:16:44,504 --> 01:16:46,580
I'm right behind you, Chuck.

1220
01:17:12,941 --> 01:17:14,600
<i>We're comin'</i>

1221
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,611
<i>We're comin', Leo</i>

1222
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:23,820
<i>So, Leo, don't despair</i>

1223
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,028
<i>While you are in the cave-in hopin'</i>

1224
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:28,781
<i>We are up above you gropin'</i>

1225
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:32,160
<i>And we soon will make an openin'</i>

1226
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,252
<i>Leo</i>

1227
01:17:34,504 --> 01:17:39,375
<i>We're closer
We're closer, Leo</i>

1228
01:17:39,475 --> 01:17:43,963
<i>And soon you'll breathe fresh air</i>

1229
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,841
<i>While you are in the devil's prison</i>

1230
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:49,093
<i>Keep that spark of life a-fizzin'</i>

1231
01:17:49,193 --> 01:17:54,098
<i>We'll soon have you out of prison, Leo</i>

1232
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:56,392
<i>Oh, Leo, Leo</i>

1233
01:17:56,492 --> 01:17:59,485
<i>Leo, Leo</i>

1234
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:03,616
<i>Be steadfast and keep your spirits high</i>

1235
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:09,205
<i>We're comin'
We're comin', Leo</i>

1236
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:19,457
I want to take this opportunity...

1237
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:21,793
of thankin' you people
of the television audience...

1238
01:18:21,893 --> 01:18:25,713
for the hundreds of letters and
telegrams that have been pourin' in.

1239
01:18:25,813 --> 01:18:29,717
I only wish that I could reach right
out there and shake you by the hand...

1240
01:18:29,817 --> 01:18:32,011
each and every one of you.

1241
01:18:32,111 --> 01:18:34,347
But there's one thing
that I want to make plain...

1242
01:18:34,447 --> 01:18:37,266
to you good people
of Los Barrios County.

1243
01:18:37,366 --> 01:18:39,268
When election day rolls around...

1244
01:18:39,368 --> 01:18:43,606
I don't want what I'm doin' here
to influence your vote one little bit.

1245
01:18:43,706 --> 01:18:48,327
Because all I'm doin' here
is my duty as your sheriff.

1246
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:45,384
<i>We're comin'
We're comin', Leo</i>

1247
01:19:46,553 --> 01:19:51,005
<i>Leo, don't despair</i>

1248
01:19:51,105 --> 01:19:53,634
<i>While you are in the cave-in hopin'</i>

1249
01:19:53,734 --> 01:19:56,220
<i>We are up above you gropin'</i>

1250
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,649
<i>And we soon will make an openin', Leo</i>

1251
01:20:01,735 --> 01:20:05,738
<i>We're closer
We're closer, Leo</i>

1252
01:20:06,823 --> 01:20:11,319
<i>And soon you'll breathe fresh air</i>

1253
01:20:11,419 --> 01:20:14,488
<i>While you are in the devil's prison</i>

1254
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:16,908
<i>Keep that spark of life a-fizzin'</i>

1255
01:20:17,008 --> 01:20:21,329
<i>We'll soon have you out of prison, Leo</i>

1256
01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:23,414
<i>Oh, Leo, Leo</i>

1257
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:26,506
<i>Leo, Leo</i>

1258
01:20:26,843 --> 01:20:30,922
<i>Be steadfast and keep your spirits high</i>

1259
01:20:31,022 --> 01:20:33,007
- Sing louder!
<i>- We're diggin'</i>

1260
01:20:33,107 --> 01:20:35,601
<i>We're diggin', Leo</i>

1261
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:40,806
<i>We've come to set you free</i>

1262
01:20:40,906 --> 01:20:42,934
<i>We can look you in the eye</i>

1263
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:45,770
<i>When you are free beneath the sky</i>

1264
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:49,448
Hey, how about some more ice here?

1265
01:21:10,261 --> 01:21:12,763
- Yes, Mr. Tatum?
- Close that door.

1266
01:21:15,976 --> 01:21:17,885
What can the management do for you?

1267
01:21:17,985 --> 01:21:21,514
I'll tell you what you can do. You can stop
playing games with those newsboys.

1268
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:23,683
- They're nice fellas.
- They're sharpies.

1269
01:21:23,783 --> 01:21:25,977
They'll rope you into
a game of 20 questions.

1270
01:21:26,077 --> 01:21:27,561
And 20 questions
take 20 answers.

1271
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:29,605
And one of them
may be the wrong one.

1272
01:21:29,705 --> 01:21:32,566
Don't worry, Mr. Tatum. They just
want me to write somethin' for them.

1273
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:36,904
- Write what?
- My life with Leo... in three parts.

1274
01:21:37,004 --> 01:21:38,990
I got 'em up to $750.

1275
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:41,409
Tell 'em you can't spell.

1276
01:21:41,509 --> 01:21:43,744
I told them I'm not
interested in their 750.

1277
01:21:43,844 --> 01:21:47,456
And you're not interested in a thousand,
2,000 or 3,000, understand?

1278
01:21:47,556 --> 01:21:51,085
And I'm not interested
in a three-part story either.

1279
01:21:51,185 --> 01:21:54,255
It's the fourth part
I'm thinkin' about.

1280
01:21:54,355 --> 01:21:57,516
After I get out of here,
I'm figurin' on goin' to New York too.

1281
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:01,554
Maybe I'll run into you.

1282
01:22:01,654 --> 01:22:03,981
Maybe you'll buy me a couple of drinks.

1283
01:22:05,191 --> 01:22:07,935
Maybe you'll even take me out
for a big evening, huh?

1284
01:22:08,035 --> 01:22:09,628
How big?

1285
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:11,939
You won't be ashamed of me.

1286
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:14,450
I'm gonna buy me a new trousseau
and look real swell.

1287
01:22:17,037 --> 01:22:21,248
Why don't you wash
that platinum out of your hair?

1288
01:22:30,258 --> 01:22:32,668
This is radio station KOAT, Albuquerque.

1289
01:22:32,768 --> 01:22:34,253
Bob Bumpas speaking...

1290
01:22:34,353 --> 01:22:37,715
and bringing you our 10:00 p.m.
special events newscast from Escudero.

1291
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:41,469
This is the fifth night the big drill has been
pounding and grinding its way toward Leo.

1292
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:44,472
The rescue workers
are now only 26 feet away.

1293
01:22:44,572 --> 01:22:48,601
At the rate they are going, they should
reach Leo by this time tomorrow night.

1294
01:22:48,701 --> 01:22:52,438
So after 129 hours
of being buried alive...

1295
01:22:52,538 --> 01:22:54,573
at last, freedom seems in sight.

1296
01:22:58,745 --> 01:23:01,413
Now put it on your right side, Leo.

1297
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,700
Underneath your arm.

1298
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,369
A little lower.

1299
01:23:07,469 --> 01:23:09,755
Breathe through your mouth.

1300
01:23:10,924 --> 01:23:12,925
Move it down a little.

1301
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:16,921
Breathe. Through your mouth.

1302
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:20,091
- I can't.
- Don't talk, please. Just breathe.

1303
01:23:20,191 --> 01:23:22,267
Now, on the other side.

1304
01:23:24,229 --> 01:23:27,681
I can't anymore.
Get me Father Diegos.

1305
01:23:27,781 --> 01:23:30,184
Shut up, Leo.
Do what the doctor tells you.

1306
01:23:30,284 --> 01:23:34,522
Chuck, don't... don't let me die
without the priest.

1307
01:23:34,622 --> 01:23:37,441
You don't need a priest.
You're not going to die.

1308
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,985
Tell him he's not gonna die, Doctor.

1309
01:23:40,085 --> 01:23:44,865
Everybody's gonna die someday, Leo.
I am. Tatum is. You are.

1310
01:23:44,965 --> 01:23:47,326
But you still have
a long time ahead of you.

1311
01:23:47,426 --> 01:23:51,413
Only you have to help.
Now, put it on the left side.

1312
01:23:51,513 --> 01:23:55,467
Way over. There. Breathe.

1313
01:23:59,389 --> 01:24:01,390
They'll never let me go.

1314
01:24:02,892 --> 01:24:05,435
They're gettin' even with me
for robbing their tomb.

1315
01:24:06,437 --> 01:24:08,480
They'll never let me go.

1316
01:24:14,863 --> 01:24:17,022
- Pneumonia.
- How bad?

1317
01:24:17,122 --> 01:24:19,024
He told you himself.

1318
01:24:19,124 --> 01:24:22,111
- Nobody dies of pneumonia these days.
- He will.

1319
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:25,322
You can't lie down here five days
and five nights in the same position.

1320
01:24:25,422 --> 01:24:27,408
What can you do?

1321
01:24:27,508 --> 01:24:29,835
We can get him some oxygen
and help him breathe.

1322
01:24:31,421 --> 01:24:33,455
How long can he hold out?

1323
01:24:33,555 --> 01:24:35,666
Oh, 12 hours.

1324
01:24:35,766 --> 01:24:39,344
Unless we get him in a hospital
tomorrow morning, he'll be dead.

1325
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:43,697
Chuck. Chuck!

1326
01:24:45,518 --> 01:24:48,804
- Yes, Leo?
- Tell 'em to stop the drill.

1327
01:24:48,904 --> 01:24:51,932
It's no use.
They'll never make it.

1328
01:24:52,032 --> 01:24:55,277
Get those ideas out of your head.
You're talkin' crazy.

1329
01:24:56,362 --> 01:24:58,314
You'll be out of here
by tomorrow morning.

1330
01:24:58,414 --> 01:25:00,407
No, I won't.

1331
01:25:01,492 --> 01:25:04,036
They'll never reach me
by tomorrow morning.

1332
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:07,114
I figured it out myself.

1333
01:25:07,214 --> 01:25:10,542
You'll be out of here
in 12 hours! Hang on!

1334
01:25:12,545 --> 01:25:15,881
You wouldn't be lyin' to me now,
would you, Chuck?

1335
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,967
Leo, look at me.

1336
01:25:30,939 --> 01:25:33,515
No, you... you wouldn't.

1337
01:25:33,615 --> 01:25:35,609
You never have.

1338
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,120
Here.

1339
01:25:54,128 --> 01:25:55,663
How do you like
that dumb snake?

1340
01:25:55,763 --> 01:25:57,539
I feed him meat.
I feed him cheese.

1341
01:25:57,639 --> 01:26:00,167
I even caught him some bugs.

1342
01:26:00,267 --> 01:26:02,836
Won't touch a thing.
What do you think he goes for?

1343
01:26:02,936 --> 01:26:05,172
Chewin' gum!

1344
01:26:05,272 --> 01:26:07,766
But only with the silver wrapper on it.

1345
01:26:10,603 --> 01:26:13,522
Look at him.
He's puttin' on weight.

1346
01:26:15,942 --> 01:26:19,353
Say, Chuck, I think we ought to
get together about tomorrow night.

1347
01:26:19,453 --> 01:26:21,981
The kid'll be out,
so let's make a big thing of it.

1348
01:26:22,081 --> 01:26:25,067
Now, the moment they bring him up,
I wanna shake hands with him.

1349
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:27,069
But I gotta be the first one.

1350
01:26:27,169 --> 01:26:29,863
Then I'm gonna make a speech
from the top of the hill.

1351
01:26:29,963 --> 01:26:33,583
I want you to write it for me...
somethin' nice and simple.

1352
01:26:34,627 --> 01:26:37,921
Hey, what's this?

1353
01:26:41,634 --> 01:26:44,586
What are you sendin' out here?
What new development?

1354
01:26:44,686 --> 01:26:46,964
What's this all about?

1355
01:26:47,064 --> 01:26:49,425
You read it. We'll have
Leo out by tomorrow morning.

1356
01:26:49,525 --> 01:26:51,510
- We're going the other way.
- What other way?

1357
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:55,723
The way we could have gone
in the first place... the easy way.

1358
01:26:55,823 --> 01:26:57,774
Now why should we do that?

1359
01:26:58,901 --> 01:27:02,396
I'll tell you why.
Because the guy in there is dying.

1360
01:27:02,496 --> 01:27:04,398
That's no good for my story.

1361
01:27:04,498 --> 01:27:06,400
When you have a big
human interest story...

1362
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,028
you've got to give it a big
human interest ending.

1363
01:27:09,128 --> 01:27:13,198
When you get people steamed up like this,
don't ever make suckers out of them.

1364
01:27:13,298 --> 01:27:16,994
I don't want to hand them
a dead man. That's why.

1365
01:27:17,094 --> 01:27:20,289
- Well, who says he's gonna be dead?
- I say so.

1366
01:27:20,389 --> 01:27:23,459
Well, maybe he will and maybe he won't,
but I know one thing for sure.

1367
01:27:23,559 --> 01:27:26,462
If we make that switch now,
we got a lot of explainin' to do.

1368
01:27:26,562 --> 01:27:28,630
People are gonna wanna
know a lot of things...

1369
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:30,632
especially them
reporter friends of yours.

1370
01:27:30,732 --> 01:27:33,886
Like, for instance, why did
we have to set up that drill?

1371
01:27:33,986 --> 01:27:36,430
Why did we waste five days?

1372
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:39,266
First, let's get him out.
Then we'll think of what to tell them.

1373
01:27:39,366 --> 01:27:42,478
Why should we stick out our necks?
Why not stick to the drill?

1374
01:27:42,578 --> 01:27:44,480
We'll speed it up
as much as we can...

1375
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:47,149
and if we get him while
he's still alive, well, fine.

1376
01:27:47,249 --> 01:27:50,202
If we're too late, well,
we done the best we could.

1377
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:54,031
It's a better story
if we're not too late.

1378
01:27:54,131 --> 01:27:56,033
I've sent for Smollett.

1379
01:27:56,133 --> 01:27:59,745
Smollett's my man,
and he's takin' my orders.

1380
01:27:59,845 --> 01:28:01,838
Wait a minute, Gus.

1381
01:28:04,467 --> 01:28:06,267
Sit down.

1382
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:16,595
Now when Smollett comes,
you can give him your orders.

1383
01:28:16,695 --> 01:28:18,806
Tell him to go in
through the cliff dwelling...

1384
01:28:18,906 --> 01:28:21,308
shore it up
and get him out fast.

1385
01:28:21,408 --> 01:28:23,310
Not through the cliff dwelling.

1386
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:26,071
You can't get him out that way anymore.

1387
01:28:28,574 --> 01:28:29,574
Why?

1388
01:28:30,118 --> 01:28:33,654
Because we've been pounding away
with that drill too long.

1389
01:28:33,754 --> 01:28:37,157
They're all shot, those walls.
You can't shore 'em up now.

1390
01:28:37,257 --> 01:28:41,169
Put a lot of men to work in there,
and they'll cave in on 'em.

1391
01:28:43,631 --> 01:28:46,041
Don't look at me like that.

1392
01:28:46,141 --> 01:28:48,669
I never wanted to use the drill
in the first place.

1393
01:28:48,769 --> 01:28:51,296
I never wanted to go in on this at all.

1394
01:28:51,396 --> 01:28:53,390
You know that.

1395
01:29:23,379 --> 01:29:26,623
I'm sorry, Mr. Nagel.
He's not back yet.

1396
01:29:26,723 --> 01:29:28,709
No, I don't know where he is.

1397
01:29:28,809 --> 01:29:32,880
Well, yes, Mr. Nagel, I left word
everyplace for him to call New York.

1398
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:35,466
Yes, I know he has a deadline.

1399
01:29:35,566 --> 01:29:38,051
Well, of course he hasn't
answered the Teletype, Mr. Nagel.

1400
01:29:38,151 --> 01:29:40,721
He hasn't been in all night.

1401
01:29:40,821 --> 01:29:43,891
Yes, I know how much
you're paying him.

1402
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:47,277
If Tatum said he's gonna
send more, he'll send more.

1403
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:03,308
Chuck! Chuck!

1404
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:06,713
- Where are you, Chuck?
- Here I am, Leo.

1405
01:30:10,009 --> 01:30:12,009
Over here.

1406
01:30:14,388 --> 01:30:16,381
I thought you went away.

1407
01:30:16,481 --> 01:30:19,351
Put that thing back on your mouth,
and take a good long drag.

1408
01:30:20,394 --> 01:30:22,054
It's morning, isn't it?

1409
01:30:22,154 --> 01:30:24,806
Leo, you have to breathe that oxygen.

1410
01:30:24,906 --> 01:30:26,399
Friday morning.

1411
01:30:27,693 --> 01:30:30,529
Come on.
Come on, up there.

1412
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,066
Make all the noise you want.

1413
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:35,958
Hurry up.

1414
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,560
I'm all set.

1415
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:42,032
I got one leg out already.

1416
01:30:42,132 --> 01:30:43,524
See it?

1417
01:30:49,215 --> 01:30:51,216
Cut out all that talking, Leo.

1418
01:30:53,052 --> 01:30:55,629
Five years today.

1419
01:30:55,729 --> 01:30:58,257
I hope she hasn't
found the present.

1420
01:30:58,357 --> 01:31:00,926
I want to give it to her myself.

1421
01:31:01,026 --> 01:31:02,519
I hid it in a good place...

1422
01:31:03,729 --> 01:31:07,641
in the cupboard of my room,
in my old barracks bag.

1423
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:09,851
She'll never find it there.

1424
01:31:09,951 --> 01:31:12,312
I want her to wear it.

1425
01:31:12,412 --> 01:31:14,739
She'll look like a million.

1426
01:31:20,371 --> 01:31:22,990
Why is it so hot in here?
It's so hot.

1427
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:25,659
'Cause you're talking too much.

1428
01:31:25,759 --> 01:31:29,162
Don't be so dumb,
using up all your strength!

1429
01:31:29,262 --> 01:31:31,548
Breathe that oxygen!
Breathe!

1430
01:31:34,844 --> 01:31:37,762
Don't you want to get
your other leg out?

1431
01:31:38,848 --> 01:31:41,850
Yeah, sure. I have to.

1432
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:47,939
So I can walk down the hill,
walk home...

1433
01:31:49,609 --> 01:31:52,352
walk up the stairs to our room...

1434
01:31:52,452 --> 01:31:54,821
so I can give her the present.

1435
01:31:56,449 --> 01:31:58,775
Up the stairs.

1436
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:00,785
Up the stairs.

1437
01:32:01,787 --> 01:32:04,587
Up the stairs.

1438
01:32:04,749 --> 01:32:06,750
Up the stairs.

1439
01:32:19,555 --> 01:32:21,556
I didn't say come in.

1440
01:32:22,767 --> 01:32:25,393
Now get out, will you, Chuck?
I wanted to surprise you.

1441
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:30,057
I'm changin' my type.
Goin' light brown again.

1442
01:32:30,157 --> 01:32:33,401
That's the color it was before
I started foolin' around with it.

1443
01:32:36,656 --> 01:32:40,116
I'm cuttin' it shorter too.
What do you think?

1444
01:32:43,996 --> 01:32:47,616
Herbie's been lookin' for you all night.
Where have you been?

1445
01:32:47,716 --> 01:32:51,044
- What's that?
- Here.

1446
01:32:52,838 --> 01:32:54,206
What is it?

1447
01:32:54,306 --> 01:32:56,249
- A present.
- For me?

1448
01:32:56,349 --> 01:32:59,670
- It's your anniversary, Mrs. Minosa.
- Oh.

1449
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:02,180
Go on. Open it.
He wants you to have it.

1450
01:33:08,896 --> 01:33:11,098
"Parisian Furs."

1451
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:13,191
All the way from Albuquerque.

1452
01:33:15,194 --> 01:33:17,187
Gorgeous, isn't it?

1453
01:33:17,287 --> 01:33:19,940
They must have skinned
a couple of hungry rats.

1454
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,275
- Put it on.
- Honey.

1455
01:33:22,375 --> 01:33:25,203
You wouldn't want me
to wear a thing like this.

1456
01:33:30,376 --> 01:33:33,954
He bought it for you, didn't he?
Now put it on.

1457
01:33:34,054 --> 01:33:37,582
Not me. I got enough money
to buy me a real fur... a silver fox.

1458
01:33:37,682 --> 01:33:39,918
- He wants you to wear it.
- I don't care what...

1459
01:33:40,018 --> 01:33:41,018
I do.

1460
01:33:42,513 --> 01:33:44,673
- I hate it, Chuck!
- Don't take it off.

1461
01:33:44,773 --> 01:33:48,135
- It's like him touching me.
- You know what he said?

1462
01:33:48,235 --> 01:33:50,220
He said you'll look like a million.

1463
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,431
- Let me go, Chuck.
- You know what else he said?

1464
01:33:52,531 --> 01:33:55,058
He said maybe you'll love him now
after what's happened to him.

1465
01:33:55,158 --> 01:33:57,144
Maybe you and he
can start all over again.

1466
01:33:57,244 --> 01:33:59,563
- Let go!
- You're all he talks about.

1467
01:33:59,663 --> 01:34:01,982
- You're all he thinks about.
- Chuck!

1468
01:34:02,082 --> 01:34:05,819
You can buy yourself a dozen silver foxes,
but you're gonna wear this.

1469
01:34:05,919 --> 01:34:08,511
Don't, Chuck!

1470
01:34:08,873 --> 01:34:10,782
Don't! I can't breathe!

1471
01:34:10,882 --> 01:34:14,002
He can't breathe either.

1472
01:34:36,108 --> 01:34:38,109
Now keep it on.

1473
01:37:56,976 --> 01:38:00,095
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

1474
01:38:00,195 --> 01:38:03,264
<i>And a brawla, brawla sooit</i>

1475
01:38:03,364 --> 01:38:07,268
<i>Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah</i>

1476
01:38:07,368 --> 01:38:09,479
<i>And a brawla sooit</i>

1477
01:38:09,579 --> 01:38:11,481
<i>- Hut-sut Rawl...</i>
- Leo.

1478
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:13,483
Father Diegos?

1479
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:16,869
- Is that you, Father?
- Yes, Leo.

1480
01:38:17,997 --> 01:38:19,998
Is Chuck with ya?

1481
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,001
I'm right here, Leo.

1482
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:27,122
See that she gets
the present, Chuck.

1483
01:38:27,222 --> 01:38:29,249
She's wearing it.

1484
01:38:29,349 --> 01:38:31,626
She... She is?

1485
01:38:31,726 --> 01:38:35,179
How does she like it?
Does she look pretty in it?

1486
01:38:36,557 --> 01:38:38,357
Yes, Leo.

1487
01:38:40,936 --> 01:38:42,937
Thanks, Chuck.

1488
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,400
I'm ready.

1489
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:07,620
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1490
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,713
I'm sorry.

1491
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:43,331
Amen.

1492
01:40:00,432 --> 01:40:03,384
What's holding up those oil drums?

1493
01:40:03,484 --> 01:40:05,478
Send them up!

1494
01:40:36,135 --> 01:40:39,637
Stop the drill.
Stop everything.

1495
01:40:47,729 --> 01:40:48,929
Quiet!

1496
01:40:49,731 --> 01:40:52,725
Quiet, everybody!

1497
01:40:52,825 --> 01:40:56,362
Shut off that music and listen!

1498
01:40:57,990 --> 01:41:00,316
This is Charles Tatum speaking!

1499
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:02,861
Listen to me!

1500
01:41:02,961 --> 01:41:05,621
Listen! Listen!

1501
01:41:13,672 --> 01:41:16,833
Leo Minosa is dead.

1502
01:41:16,933 --> 01:41:19,586
He died a quarter of an hour ago...

1503
01:41:19,686 --> 01:41:23,347
with the drill just 10 feet away.

1504
01:41:30,522 --> 01:41:34,017
There's nothing
we can do anymore.

1505
01:41:34,117 --> 01:41:36,102
There's nothing anybody can do.

1506
01:41:36,202 --> 01:41:38,154
He's dead. Do you hear me?

1507
01:41:51,126 --> 01:41:54,295
Now go on home, all of you!

1508
01:41:55,756 --> 01:41:58,132
The circus is over.

1509
01:42:04,806 --> 01:42:07,300
Operator, get me Chicago!

1510
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,678
Operator! Operator!
This is a press rush.

1511
01:42:10,778 --> 01:42:14,398
Get me New York.
Longacre 5-7598.

1512
01:44:22,861 --> 01:44:25,029
What are they doing with that?

1513
01:44:26,573 --> 01:44:29,984
They're taking it away.
Orders from New York.

1514
01:44:30,084 --> 01:44:32,362
You never heard anybody
as mad as Nagel.

1515
01:44:32,462 --> 01:44:34,614
I don't get it either, Chuck.
Where were you?

1516
01:44:34,714 --> 01:44:37,200
What's the idea of not
protecting your own paper?

1517
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:41,120
You had it all for yourself.
You had it first.

1518
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,456
He told me to tell you
you're fired.

1519
01:44:43,556 --> 01:44:45,549
Get me a drink.

1520
01:44:54,476 --> 01:44:57,929
So they moved your piano out, eh?
What are you gonna play on now?

1521
01:44:58,029 --> 01:45:00,056
Had everything sewed up,
didn't you, Tatum?

1522
01:45:00,156 --> 01:45:02,350
Everything but the payoff.
What slipped up?

1523
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:04,042
Beat it.

1524
01:45:04,444 --> 01:45:07,146
Booze yourself out of
another job, fan?

1525
01:45:07,246 --> 01:45:10,900
The great Tatum. Better wipe his mouth.

1526
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,910
Beat it. Beat it.

1527
01:45:13,995 --> 01:45:17,323
- You heard him. Outside, all of you.
- Where do you go from here, Tatum?

1528
01:45:17,423 --> 01:45:20,084
Maybe the kid can get you a job
on a high school paper.

1529
01:45:21,253 --> 01:45:24,705
Put in a call to New York.
I wanna talk to Nagel.

1530
01:45:24,805 --> 01:45:28,084
Aren't you a little late, Tatum?
The papers are on the street now.

1531
01:45:28,184 --> 01:45:30,886
Don't stand there, Herbie.
Get Nagel.

1532
01:45:31,888 --> 01:45:34,757
What are you gonna flash
to them? How they weave a Navajo rug?

1533
01:45:34,857 --> 01:45:37,635
- That ought to be worth a thousand a day.
- Get me New York.

1534
01:45:37,735 --> 01:45:40,012
Look, Tatum, you were good to us.
We'll be good to you.

1535
01:45:40,112 --> 01:45:42,807
Here's a hot tip.
We just got it from the sheriff.

1536
01:45:42,907 --> 01:45:46,269
He's gonna dig Leo out yet
and give him a big send-off.

1537
01:45:46,369 --> 01:45:48,813
Get out. Get out!

1538
01:45:48,913 --> 01:45:51,274
See you in New York when you
pick up that Pulitzer prize.

1539
01:45:51,374 --> 01:45:52,966
Get out!

1540
01:45:57,038 --> 01:45:59,707
Okay, hold it. Nagel.

1541
01:46:09,384 --> 01:46:11,802
Hello, Nagel? Tatum.

1542
01:46:13,054 --> 01:46:16,348
Wait a minute.
Don't yell at me!

1543
01:46:17,434 --> 01:46:20,386
Sure. Sure, I let you down.

1544
01:46:20,486 --> 01:46:23,347
I know they're on the street...
the other papers.

1545
01:46:23,447 --> 01:46:27,768
Sure. Sure. Everybody else got the story.
Only it's the wrong story.

1546
01:46:27,868 --> 01:46:29,862
Shut up, I said!

1547
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:33,858
Leo Minosa didn't die.

1548
01:46:33,958 --> 01:46:35,276
He was murdered.

1549
01:46:35,376 --> 01:46:37,904
Is that the best you can think of?

1550
01:46:38,004 --> 01:46:40,615
Stop it, Tatum.
You're wasting your breath.

1551
01:46:40,715 --> 01:46:43,159
Now let me tell you
the story behind the story.

1552
01:46:43,259 --> 01:46:47,622
You got drunk yesterday, you were
drunk all night, and you're still drunk!

1553
01:46:47,722 --> 01:46:49,624
All right, I'm crazy!

1554
01:46:49,724 --> 01:46:51,792
But it's only because
I took a chance on you!

1555
01:46:51,892 --> 01:46:55,087
And I'm giving you your money's worth...
a Tatum special.

1556
01:46:55,187 --> 01:46:57,924
Something that'll make
all the other papers look sick.

1557
01:46:58,024 --> 01:47:00,593
Hey, Nagel, you wouldn't
be sap enough to hang up on me.

1558
01:47:00,693 --> 01:47:02,595
Not now. Listen to this.

1559
01:47:02,695 --> 01:47:05,306
"Reporter Keeps Man Buried
for Six Days."

1560
01:47:05,406 --> 01:47:07,433
Now get set for the rest of it.

1561
01:47:07,533 --> 01:47:09,435
Nagel! Nagel!

1562
01:47:09,535 --> 01:47:10,728
Nagel!

1563
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:13,822
New York?

1564
01:47:17,369 --> 01:47:19,654
Running a big-city newspaper.

1565
01:47:19,754 --> 01:47:22,698
That bald-headed idiot.

1566
01:47:22,798 --> 01:47:24,750
He won't believe me.

1567
01:47:26,044 --> 01:47:28,796
You believe me, don't you?

1568
01:47:30,382 --> 01:47:32,383
Yes, I do, Chuck.

1569
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:36,295
Now let me help you.
I'll take you to a doctor or a hospital.

1570
01:47:36,395 --> 01:47:38,430
Forget the doctor.

1571
01:47:39,432 --> 01:47:41,467
We've got things to do.

1572
01:47:41,567 --> 01:47:44,262
Like, for instance, reelect a sheriff.

1573
01:47:44,362 --> 01:47:46,730
Come on, fan.
We got a deadline.

1574
01:48:28,982 --> 01:48:31,317
Come on, Herbie.
You're wastin' my time.

1575
01:49:36,466 --> 01:49:37,966
Sit down.

1576
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:40,920
That's your desk.

1577
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:43,013
Now go to work.

1578
01:49:50,939 --> 01:49:53,432
What's the matter with everybody?

1579
01:49:53,532 --> 01:49:56,102
Haven't you ever seen me before?

1580
01:49:56,202 --> 01:49:58,396
Go on! It's getting late!

1581
01:49:58,496 --> 01:50:00,489
Your paper starts
printing in an hour.

1582
01:50:02,242 --> 01:50:04,042
Mr. Boot!

1583
01:50:05,704 --> 01:50:08,704
Boot! Mr. Boot!

1584
01:50:12,877 --> 01:50:14,878
Where's Boot?

1585
01:50:19,801 --> 01:50:22,001
Yes, Chuck.

1586
01:50:26,141 --> 01:50:30,386
How'd you like to make yourself
a thousand dollars a day, Mr. Boot?

1587
01:50:30,486 --> 01:50:33,931
I'm a thousand-dollar-a-day
newspaperman.

1588
01:50:34,031 --> 01:50:36,650
You can have me for nothing.

1589
01:50:37,305 --> 01:50:43,678
