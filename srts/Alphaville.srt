1
00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:01,829
Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

2
00:00:01,897 --> 00:00:04,861
Agent Sullivan just called.
We have an Alpha missing--

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,160
Skylar Adams.

4
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:08,027
Skylar's smarter than
just about anyone.

5
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,693
She was always
inventing things.

6
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:13,227
Are you looking
for my mommy?

7
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:15,828
I was going to head out
to, uh--to the coffee shop.

8
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:17,761
Are you asking me out
on a date?

9
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,362
If we're gonna try this,

10
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,762
we're gonna need
to take it slow.

11
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,495
Slow is good.

12
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:27,262
Dr. Rosen...

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,796
Cornell Scipio.

14
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:34,231
- Is that a photic stimulator?
- There's 42 different models.

15
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:36,398
You remember the young woman
who built you your phone?

16
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:38,699
- Yeah, Skylar.
- Do you still have it with you?

17
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,198
She said I could call her
on this.

18
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,899
She might be the one
to figure out

19
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:44,801
how this thing works.

20
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:47,670
Identities of all volunteers
remain classified.

21
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:50,504
The purpose of the study
is to test reactions

22
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,406
to various frequencies
of light oscillation.

23
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:56,008
Project Bluebird,
Artichoke, Paper Clip--

24
00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:57,542
you believe these names?

25
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,345
These Cold War programs were
the government's first attempts

26
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:03,346
to explore the limits of
the human neurological system.

27
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,948
And one of
the more promising experiments

28
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,817
was photic stimulation--

29
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:10,518
visual stimulus
to alter brain activity.

30
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:12,252
But as you can see,

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,654
some pretty
horrible results.

32
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:15,755
I still don't get
the connection to your toy here.

33
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:18,157
You said they use this
to treat people for epilepsy

34
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,458
and Parkinson's
and lazy eye syndrome.

35
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:23,026
Well, Bill, Stanton Parish
somehow managed to coerce

36
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:25,195
Senator Burton to fast-track
this particular device

37
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:26,462
through the FDA.

38
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,997
I seriously doubt
he was concerned

39
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:29,698
with lazy eye syndrome.

40
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,199
So you had Kat
take this thing apart.

41
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,600
She couldn't find anything.

42
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:33,768
Yeah, but why?

43
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:35,869
Why, Bill, was it used
so deliberately

44
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:38,271
on that Jason Miller kid
in the hospital?

45
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:40,106
It enhanced his Alpha ability,

46
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:43,141
which put you and the rest
of the team in danger.

47
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,209
Thousands of these are due
to be distributed right now.

48
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:48,378
I'm convinced that this--
this--well, whatever it is--

49
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:51,047
is a crucial part
of Parish's war plans.

50
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:52,814
And I hate to think
what will happen

51
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:54,249
if I can't figure out
what it does.

52
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:55,817
Well, whatever it is,

53
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:58,385
Nathan Cley needs this on his
desk tomorrow morning, okay?

54
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,753
That is evidence.

55
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,354
Yeah, well,
it's not going to be

56
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,355
on Nathan Cley's desk
tomorrow morning.

57
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,857
It's going to be
on Skylar Adams's.

58
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,991
If anyone can figure this out,
it's her.

59

You know, I checked.

61
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,105
Health inspectors eat here.

62
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:30,305
I'm so sorry.

63
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:32,907
It's--
it's a force of habit.

64
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,275
Oh.

65
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,010
You know what?
I should get going.

66
00:02:36,078 --> 00:02:38,512
You're really not gonna
tell me where you're going?

67
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,914
Dr. Rosen's being really
paranoid about security.

68
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,882
You know
I'm head of tactical, right?

69
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,950
Your boss is making it really
hard for me to do my job.

70
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:47,018
Do you want to come along
to protect me?

71
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:53,089
That's sweet.

72
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,824
Look, I just--

73
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,425
I'm sorry.
- No, no--

74
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,060
No, John, I'm sorry.
I--

75
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,227
I'm trying, okay?

76
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:03,830
And we'll get there, but...

77
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:07,266
I got to go.

78
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,636
Dr. Rosen,
why do I have to go?

79
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:12,404
I don't want to go.
I don't like going places.

80
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:13,705
Gary, you're part
of the team.

81
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,374
And I want everyone
doing security.

82
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,276
No, but Bill--
he does the security.

83
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:18,577
'Cause Bi--
Bill's the muscle,

84
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:19,945
and the muscle is
in the arm.

85
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,947
I'm the brain, and the brain
stays in the head.

86
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:23,348
The office is the head.

87
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,983
That's my metaphor.
Right, right.

88
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,418
That's a great metaphor, Gary,
you are the brains, okay?

89
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,619
Yeah, well,
then tell Dr. Rosen--

90
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,121
the brain stays in the head.

91
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:31,223
Gary, when Stanton Parish
finds out we have this device,

92
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,058
he's going to come
looking for it.

93
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,492
You are too important
to be left behind.

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,660
You monitor signals.

95
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:36,994
No one else can do that,
all right?

96
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:38,930
You're going.
Oh, okay. But then you ha-

97
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:40,998
you have to appease me.

98
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,566
Appease you?

99
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:45,469
Okay, all right, Gary,
how about you pick

100
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,970
where we stop for lunch?
Yeah, that's good.

101
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:48,605
How about we let him
drive us to lunch?

102
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:50,373
- No, no, I'm the shotgun.
- I'm gonna let you drive.

103
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,742
That's fool's gold, Bill.
You never let me drive.

104
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:53,843
Rachel?

105
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,882
- Where are you going?
- To see a guy about a thing.

106
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,284
You gonna miss me?
No.

107
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:04,353
Well, I bet I can change
your mind on that.

108
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

109
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:10,426
What, you don't like
office hours?

110
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:12,361
Sorry.
The subway was late.

111
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:13,596
Bentley's in the shop?

112
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:15,598
No. The Bentley
was repossessed.

113
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,400
She couldn't afford
to make the payments.

114
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:19,702
And she's not allowed to push
anyone anymore to keep the car.

115
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,203
So Nina's going, huh?

116
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,638
Yeah. Look, nothing's
gonna happen, okay?

117
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:24,040
Just trust me.

118
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:25,609
It's not you
I'm worried about.

119
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,644
Nina's promised to use
her ability for the, uh--

120
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:29,246
for the good of all.

121
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:30,981
Yeah, that's like
asking an alcoholic

122
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:32,382
to only drink in the office.

123
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,686
I need to do this myself,
so I can handle it.

124
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,989
Give her a chance, okay?
She's trying to change.

125
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:39,390
Yeah.

126
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,993
Cameron, we need to go.
Give my love to Dani.

127
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:44,128
Your dad says hi.
All right.

128
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:50,535
I'm the shotgun.

129
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,183
Nothing but trees--
where are we?

130
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,419
Well, I think
we're almost there, Bill.

131
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:09,553
I think, I think.

132
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:11,756
You think?

133
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:14,358
Doc, what exactly
did Skylar say?

134
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:15,559
Well, she wasn't
all that specific.

135
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:17,795
No, she hung up on him.

136
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,464
But I'd already
traced the call.

137
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:21,799
She's 3.2 miles
north of Route 11.

138
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,701
All right, well,
that's around here, then.

139
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:25,736
Yeah, it is, but it's all--
it's just trees.

140
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,037
There's trees everywhere...

141
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:30,307
At least on--on Mapquest
and Google maps.

142
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,811
When you're this far out,
you don't want to be found.

143
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:35,713
Don't--oh, wait, wait!
Stop, stop!

144
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,081
What, what?

145
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:39,016
- Gary, what are you doing?
- Gary!

146
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:42,987
Gary!
What are you doing?

147
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:44,021
It's all gone!

148
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,723
There's no wi-fi.

149
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,257
There's no 4g.
Everything's gone.

150
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,193
Gary, that's what happens
when you're out in the boonies.

151
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:50,962
Can you just get back
in the van, please?

152
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:55,366
This is no good.
We have to turn back now.

153
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:57,101
We're not turning back,
Gary.

154
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,671
Just don't--don't jump
out of the van again.

155
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:01,139
I don't like the boonies!

156
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:06,845
Oh, what's this?

157
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,749
Hey.
How you fellas doing?

158
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,450
Just fine.

159
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:14,387
But you're on private land.
You need to turn around.

160
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:16,189
Excuse me, we're looking
for a friend of ours

161
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:18,091
who lives
somewhere around here.

162
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,926
Her name is Skylar Adams.

163
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:21,662
Hey, D.C.I.S.

164
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,297
Hey! Hey!

165
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,866
You have to respect that badge.
Give me it back.

166
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:28,469
You're feds.
Get the hell out of here.

167
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,870
Give me.

168
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:31,738
- Go!
- All right.

169
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,573
Get out of here.

170
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,674
- Cameron, just--
- move it.

171
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:35,675
Just go ahead.

172
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:41,181
Look out!

173
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,985
Whoa!

174
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:46,853
He's an Alpha.
You're right, Gary.

175
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:48,956
- What do the other two do?
- We don't want to find out.

176
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,490
- Hey, hey.
- He opens doors.

177
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:52,392
- Hey, hey, hey, back off.
- Guess you're walking.

178
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,761
What do you think
you're doing?

179
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,162
- Let's go!
- Gower!

180
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,231
Back off!

181
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,803
Hello, Skylar.

182
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,139
Dr. Rosen.

183
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,673
- You're Rosen?
- Yes.

184
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,542
Yes--yes, I am.
And, uh--

185
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:11,211
and you are?

186
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,981
Skylar, are these folks
friends of yours?

187
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,984
No.

188
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:18,719
Neither are you.

189
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:22,856
Skylar?

190
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:26,059
Go home.

Skylar, listen to me.

203
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,397
I know I promised I'd never
make contact with you again,

204
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:03,932
but I need your help.

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,167
- We don't help outsiders.
- What do you mean, "we"?

206
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,535
I thought you weren't
with those people.

207
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:10,271
Just tell me what you want.

208
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,540
All right.

209
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,175
Thank you, Nina.

210
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:17,812
I need you to take a look
at this.

211
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,615
It appears to be
a photic stimulator,

212
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,650
but I think
it's much more than that.

213
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,085
You want to use me
for my abilities?

214
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,455
I'm shocked.

215
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:30,091
Take it to the genius bar.
Skylar.

216
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,895
Skylar...

217
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:36,831
This is important.

218
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,067
I took a tremendous risk
helping you elude the NSA.

219
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:41,303
I did not have to do that.

220
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,638
Really?

221
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:47,041
You're playing that card?

222
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,645
- Hey! Over here!
- Kids, come this way!

223
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:51,880
Wait up!

224
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:54,182
So this is where
you ended up--

225
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,184
a town full of Alphas.

226
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,385
It's just an old summer camp
they fixed up--

227
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,120
a place for refugees.

228
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,256
Refugees from what?

229
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,759
The neuro-typical world...

230
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,127
from you.

231
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,298
You don't look
too impressed.

232
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:14,068
No. With all these
Alphas here,

233
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:15,836
you never know
who's a Parish sympathizer.

234
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,171
So we got to keep
our eyes open.

235
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,873
Why don't you stay with Rosen
and the machine?

236
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:22,909
And I'll do a security check
with, uh, Rachel and Gary.

237
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:23,844
All right.

238
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,384
Xenon tube, flash header...

239
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:35,655
50-watt step-down
power supply.

240
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:39,459
Yeah, yeah,
I know what this is.

241
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,661
It's a photic stimulator.

242
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,263
Skylar, I-I know that.

243
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,166
But t-there's
got to be more to it.

244
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,967
Hey, look who's here.

245
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:49,802
Zoe, you remember Dr. Rosen.

246
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,871
Hi, Zoe.

247
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,940
- What's this?
- Whoa. Zoe, don't touch.

248
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,308
Don't touch.
I'll show you later.

249
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,610
She never stops.
This is how it always is.

250
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:01,245
Zoe
what's this?

251
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:03,514
Zoe, Zoe,
do you like bubbles?

252
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,751
Do you want to know how to blow
a giant bubble that never pops?

253
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:07,985
How do you do that?

254
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:11,656
I'll show you.
Come here.

255
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:14,191
Let's just sit
right here.

256
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,526
Now the first thing
you have to do,

257
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:18,129
is you have to
take a deep breath.

258
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:20,331
And then...

259
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,832
blow it out slow.

260
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,601
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Here it comes.

261
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:25,069
It's getting bigger
and bigger and bigger

262
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:27,672
and bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger...

263
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,407
There you go.

264
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,381
Wow. This is
an amazing-looking creature.

265
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:37,149
Think you could draw
a picture of it for me?

266
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:38,617
Okay.

267
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:40,419
Thank you.

268
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,858
How did you do that?

269
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,926
I've had a little experience

270
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:51,797
raising a equally spirited
one of my own.

271
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,233
She just--
she never stops.

272
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,601
She wakes me up
at 4:00 in the morning

273
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:56,770
to tell me she discovered
a new prime number.

274
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:59,540
Well, as they say, the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

275
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,475
Didn't you once take apart
your family's Volkswagen

276
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,144
and make an air cannon
or something?

277
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:06,313
It was a Nissan.

278
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:09,082
Careful, careful.
That, uh--

279
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,484
that could be dangerous.

280
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:12,052
More dangerous
than an air cannon?

281
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,488
Yeah, quite possibly.

282
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:15,890
Gary, do me a favor.

283
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,791
Try to keep your eyes
in the real world, please?

284
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,494
No. I don't like only being
able to see the real world.

285
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,230
It's boring.
I hate it here.

286
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:24,532
Yeah, well, you know,
this place reminds me

287
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:27,235
of when my parents used
to send me to summer camp.

288
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:28,703
I hated it as well.

289
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,906
I couldn't sleep
without the traffic noises,

290
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,310
but after a while, you learn
to appreciate a place like this.

291
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,279
Smell that.
You smell that country air?

292
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:40,483
Oh. Bees.
Oh, no.

293
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,584
- Gary, come on, back up.
- I don't like bees, Bill.

294
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,853
They have evil intent.

295
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,287
Gary, wait, wait, wait.
Come back.

296
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,523
- Calm down, son.
- Get off! Get off!

297
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:48,058
Don't let them sting you.

298
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,701
Oh...

299
00:11:57,768 --> 00:11:59,569
You can speak bee.
Basically.

300
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,803
Huh.

301
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,372
You must be
Skylar's friends.

302
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:05,008
Um, Agent Harken?
Gary?

303
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:07,644
No. Agent Bell.
I'm an Agent, too.

304
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:09,012
Claude.
I'm the, uh, founder

305
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,547
of this colony
for people like us.

306
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,249
You're the guy I need to talk
to--I've got some questions

307
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:13,750
about security arrangements
around here.

308
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:16,653
We all get along pretty well.
We've never had any incidents.

309
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:17,955
I doubt we'll have any now.

310
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:19,423
You always want to prepare
for the worst

311
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,824
and hope for the best, right?

312
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,325
Oh, you're the founder,

313
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:24,928
so it's your fault
that there's no signals here.

314
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,665
Gary can read
electromagnetic communication,

315
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:32,569
so he gets a little cranky
in dead zones like this--

316
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,037
Bill!
I'm not cranky.

317
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,438
You're the cranky--
you're always cranky.

318
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:36,606
Yeah.

319
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:38,308
It's not exactly dead
around here.

320
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,245
Nature is crawling with signals,
if you're open to them.

321
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:44,314
Excuse me.

322
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:47,183
Okay.

323
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,588
This is amazing.

324
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:55,525
She's actually hand-drawing
algorithmic fractals.

325
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:58,162
Yeah, she's bored
with those.

326
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:00,697
She's moved on
to complex plane multibrots.

327
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:04,334
It's like having your own
little computer running around.

328
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,870
At least a computer
comes with a manual

329
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,505
and an "off" switch.

330
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:11,474
Well, it's not easy
raising an Alpha.

331
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,146
That's why we're here--

332
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:18,481
it takes a village
and all that crap.

333
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:24,053
Something is draining
the battery.

334
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:25,655
Could be a design flaw.

335
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,727
- Dinner, dinner!
- Hey--

336
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,562
Thanks, Claude.

337
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,631
Claude...

338
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:37,467
Skylar's mentioned you.
I'm Dr. Lee Rosen.

339
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:39,169
I know who you are.

340
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,241
What's that?

341
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:45,676
Good question.

342
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:54,585
I guess I'll be seeing you
at dinner.

343
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:03,794
- Uh, something I said?
- Actually, yes.

344
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,729
That stunt you pulled letting
the world know about Alphas

345
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:09,799
didn't make you
any friends here.

346
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,401
Dinner!
Come on, mommy, let's go!

347
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:13,636
Dinner!

348
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:14,837
You can leave it.
It's safe here.

349
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:17,206
No, I-I prefer
to keep it with me.

350
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,107
Wow.

351
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:22,043
You should see a shrink
about those trust issues.

352
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:25,913
Gary, where are you going?
What are you doing?

353
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:27,482
I'm going back
to the office!

354
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,050
Bill, I don't have
my things.

355
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,086
I don't have my pajamas or my
mouth guard for the bruxism.

356
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,554
- Gary, listen to me.
- I can't sleep

357
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,056
without my signals.
Gary, this is part of the job.

358
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,291
We have to be on the lookout
for any outside communication,

359
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,626
anybody trying--
Oh, Bill, I told you-

360
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,161
there are no signals.
It's not--

361
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:42,230
What?

362
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,000
What, someone out there?

363
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,435
No.

364
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:48,536
Oh.
What-what do you see?

365
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:49,871
It's a star.

366
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,539
Gary, we're not here
to look for damn stars.

367
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,874
No, it's good.

368
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,076
Some stars, they--
they send out radio waves.

369
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,745
I know that.

370
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,979
- Gary.
- It's a pulsar.

371
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,681
Gary, you're killing me
right now,

372
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:01,416
you know this, right?
It's pingy.

373
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,417
Whoo-hoo.

374
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,652
Gary.

375
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,387
Gary!

376
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:06,755
Gary, listen to me.

377
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,523
It's time to eat, okay?

378
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,925
You're late, okay?
You're late to eat, Gary.

379
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,293
Let's--can we--

380
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,162
can we look at stars
another time?

381
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:16,864
No, Bill, it's not stars.
It's something else.

382
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,766
It's all--
it's all--

383
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:23,337
it's yellow
and purple and--and red.

384
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:24,672
And it's--
it's like curtains,

385
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:26,373
but they're exploding.

386
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:29,343
Yeah, that sounds like
the Aurora Borealis, Gary.

387
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:32,513
I've seen that
in Alaska before.

388
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,448
Huh.
It's the whole sky.

389
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:43,122
Pretty amazing.

390
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:49,738
You hungry, Gary?
Hey, let's sit right here--

391
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,219
come on--with Hicks.

392
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,660
I could've killed them both.

393
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:05,275
Don't sneak up on me
like that.

394
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:06,876
It's what I do.

395
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:10,013
You're so quiet, we should tie
a frickin' bell on you.

396
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:11,849
Parish sent us here
to observe.

397
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,750
No one's around--let's just go
and grab the machine.

398
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:17,154
If we go for it now,
they'll know it's valuable.

399
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,190
We only move if they figure out
what it does.

400
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:26,738
What the hell is this?

401
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,274
See, uh,
it's a green algae.

402
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:30,843
Apparently they grow
their own food.

403
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:32,511
Really?

404
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,313
Yep. Eat up.

405
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:35,648
Gary, what's the deal?

406
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:37,583
I thought we had
radio silence out here.

407
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:39,685
Oh, yeah. No.
I-I was wrong.

408
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:41,321
There are signals everywhere.

409
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:43,356
I just--I wasn't focusing
hard enough,

410
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:44,858
'cause even the trees
have signals,

411
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:46,393
and the rocks have signals.

412
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,696
It's all--it's wavelengths,
but it's smaller.

413
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:51,064
It's like--
even this food.

414
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:53,199
This food has a signal.

415
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:54,601
It's go--
it sounds like,

416
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:57,837
Aw-wa, ba-wawawawa, ba-wawawa--

417
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,878
Yeah, that means
"don't eat me."

418
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,112
That's what this means.

419
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,114
- What else is there?
- 'Cause of the color.

420
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,150
No dessert until you
clear your plate, Digit.

421
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:09,821
Didge.

422
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,856
Look at you,
all domestic.

423
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:14,658
You even lasered off
all your tattoos.

424
00:17:14,726 --> 00:17:17,561
Or was that just to make it
harder for the FBI to spot you?

425
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:18,495
Come on, let's go.

426
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,534
Rebel...

427
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:24,835
Mom.

428
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:26,603
Rebel...

429
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,904
Mom.

430
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:29,239
I thought this was a place

431
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,341
where Alphas could be free
to be themselves.

432
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:33,243
Not me.
I'm here for Zoe.

433
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:34,978
So what, you can't be
yourself and her mom

434
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:37,047
all at the same time?

435
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:39,783
Well, right now
I'm kind of sucking at both.

436
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,993
Trouble in the Justice League?

437
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:52,397
They're not exactly thrilled
to have me around.

438
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,132
Maybe I should just
stay here with you.

439
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,600
That's a load of crap.

440
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,836
I saw you.
You were happy.

441
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:00,372
Made me want to throw up.

442
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,707
Yeah, but I ruined it.

443
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:07,279
And now when I'm with them,
I just feel alone.

444
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:08,313
This is delicious.

445
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:09,648
Honey wine.

446
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,250
You made this?

447
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:14,119
- The bees do all the work.
- Mmm.

448
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:15,721
It's human nature
to exploit

449
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:17,923
the special abilities
of other creatures.

450
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,024
Perhaps.

451
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:20,526
But it could also be perceived

452
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:24,296
as two groups working together
for their mutual benefit.

453
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:27,766
And when one disengages
from that bond,

454
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,534
both suffer.

455
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:33,004
Have you ever had a brick
thrown through your window?

456
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:35,773
Have you ever been persecuted
for being who you are?

457
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,075
Claude, I'm sorry,

458
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:38,577
but Dr. Rosen
has spent his entire career

459
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:40,645
fighting against exactly
that kind of intolerance--

460
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:42,214
- Rachel--
- His career?

461
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:44,883
This is our lives
I'm talking about.

462
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,386
And we did not elect you
to be our spokesman.

463
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:49,788
You're not one of us.
You never will be.

464
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,123
You're just an outsider
looking in.

465
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,025
Yes, I'll admit it--
I am an outsider.

466
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,361
But let me
ask you this, Claude.

467
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,763
If you knew that your bee
colonies were going to collapse

468
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:00,565
no matter where
you hide them,

469
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,768
what would you do?

470
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:05,570
Wouldn't you
try to stop it?

471
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,749
Why'd you come here, huh?

472
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,085
No!
Please, no!

473
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:30,528
I can kill more than cars.

474
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:32,330
Hey!

475
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,267
Doc!

476
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:37,835
Doc, you all right?

477
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:40,904
Yes, I think so.

478
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,339
Easy, easy, easy.

479
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,073
I got him.

480
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:48,844
What do you know
about this?

481
00:19:48,912 --> 00:19:50,513
I don't know
what you're talking about.

482
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,314
Put those away!

483
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:55,517
We don't solve things
with violence around here.

484
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,386
Oh, really?

485
00:19:57,454 --> 00:20:01,190
Perhaps you should tell
your man about that.

486
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:03,392
I didn't start this, Claude.

487
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,261
The hell you didn't!

488
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,030
You started
the whole damn thing.

489
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:11,234
My life fell apart
because of you.

490
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:15,071
My wife left me,
and she took my kids,

491
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,273
all because of you
and your big mouth.

492
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:25,047
Do you have a name?

493
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:28,984
- Gower.
- Mr. Gower...

494
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,019
I opened my big mouth

495
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,655
because it was
absolutely necessary.

496
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:35,390
If you'll just
let me explain--

497
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,792
Gower!

498
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,727
Go home.

499
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:46,367
Claude--

500
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:47,936
You can
spend the night here,

501
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,538
but I want you gone
by morning.

502
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:55,978
Come on.

503
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,580
Let's get back
to our homes.

504
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:20,084
There gonna be some way
to repair this?

505
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:22,187
Well, maybe
if you stop touching it.

506
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:23,188
Ugh.

507
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:26,924
Gower smashed this one up.

508
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:28,760
I mean, we replaced
the circuit boards.

509
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:36,067
Hey, do you see that?

510
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,647
Sneaky-ass,
clever bastards.

511
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,983
What?
W-what have you found?

512
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:52,919
Control circuits.

513
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,621
Nano-processors embedded
in the wires themselves.

514
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,324
Idiots installed it
all backwards.

515
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:01,194
Yeah, this photostim has
definitely been tampered with.

516
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:02,429
Is there any way
to determine

517
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,030
what exactly
has been done to it?

518
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:07,901
- It's gonna take some time.
- We don't have time, Skylar.

519
00:22:07,969 --> 00:22:09,903
Claude wanted us out of here
first thing this morning.

520
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,606
Lucky you.

521
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:15,610
Hey, you know, you and Zoe
can come with us.

522
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:17,211
Actually,
that's a great idea.

523
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,649
No. I brought Zoe here
to be around kids like her.

524
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,252
Every morning I wake up
and wish I could leave.

525
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,921
It was so much easier
when I was alone.

526
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:27,589
Hey, Zoe.

527
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:29,824
Zoe.

528
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,262
God!
Mother of the frickin' year.

529
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,797
Digit!

530
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:37,231
Digit?
Skylar.

531
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,033
Oh!

532
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:40,301
Ugh!

533
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:41,803
- Rachel, turn that thing off.
- Yeah, okay.

534
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,471
It's got its own
internal power source.

535
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:44,606
Maybe if I reconnect it--

536
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:48,277
Rachel!

537
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:51,180
Bill!

538
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,559
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- She's having a seizure, Bill.

539
00:23:03,627 --> 00:23:06,395
Rachel, stay with me.
Stay with me.

540
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:08,130
Dr. Rosen...

541
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:09,498
Where are you?

542
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:10,900
I can't see you.

543
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:12,769
I'm right here.

544
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:21,145
Zoe?

545
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,780
Digit.

546
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,815
Skylar.

547
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:26,884
Gary, have you seen my kid?

548
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:29,686
No, but, Skylar, I'm looking
for something too.

549
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:32,956
I want to get a cabin,
but I want one with carpet.

550
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:34,858
Everything here's made of wood,
and I like carpet,

551
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:36,960
'cause it's all--
it's squishy beneath my toes.

552
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:39,963
I don't have time for this.

553
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:42,099
Zoe?

554
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,234
- Aah!
- How did that machine do that?

555
00:23:44,302 --> 00:23:46,970
It's as if that--
that instrument, whatever it is,

556
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:49,473
has amplified
her Alpha ability.

557
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,408
So...it's like
what happened

558
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:54,378
to that coma kid
in the hospital, right?

559
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:57,648
Yes, but whatever adjustment
Skylar made to that thing

560
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:59,783
has increased its potency.

561
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:02,186
Rachel, Rachel,
what you're experiencing

562
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,422
is an intensification
of your own ability,

563
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,491
which means
you can probably control it.

564
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,926
Just focus,
go through your protocols.

565
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:09,895
You can control this.

566
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:17,468
Zoe?

567
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:51,635
Zoe!

568
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:56,673
Didge?

569
00:24:56,741 --> 00:25:00,710
I didn't mean it.

570
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:01,978
Didge?

571
00:25:09,387 --> 00:25:11,956
Come back.

572
00:25:12,023 --> 00:25:14,659
Zoe!

573
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:16,294
Zoe!

574
00:25:31,677 --> 00:25:33,544
Oh, didn't mean to scare you.

575
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:35,913
So don't sneak up on people
in the middle of the woods.

576
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,684
Who are you?

577
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:41,486
We want that machine
you fixed.

578
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:45,756
It's not mine to give.

579
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:48,559
Yeah, well,
it's not the Doc's either.

580
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:51,362
See, he stole it.
We want it back.

581
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:06,448
- You okay?
- Yeah.

582
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:08,050
- You sure?
- Yeah, fine.

583
00:26:08,117 --> 00:26:09,184
- Here, Rache.
- I'm okay.

584
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:10,485
Just get this off of me.

585
00:26:10,553 --> 00:26:12,254
I can't breathe, okay?
Just get it off of me.

586
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,590
- Shh, shh.
- Okay, just--I can't breathe.

587
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:17,093
Oh.
Rachel, what's wrong?

588
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,494
Oh, you look like
one of the faces

589
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:20,297
from my expressions chart--

590
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:21,865
j-joyless.

591
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:24,101
Rachel's sick, okay?
We're gonna take her home,

592
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,170
as soon as Dr. Rosen gets back
with that photostim.

593
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:28,539
Oh, okay, drive safe...
and really fast.

594
00:26:28,607 --> 00:26:30,207
I'm gonna go and air out
my cabin.

595
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:31,509
- What?
- Gary, you--

596
00:26:31,576 --> 00:26:33,144
your cabin?

597
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:35,613
Yeah.
Yeah, number 33.

598
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,415
Claude said
that I could live here.

599
00:26:37,483 --> 00:26:39,383
And, Nina, you can take
your office back,

600
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:41,586
'cause I-I don't need
my man cave anymore.

601
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:43,187
Gary, you're not staying.
Let's go. Get in the van.

602
00:26:43,255 --> 00:26:44,922
- No, I am staying.
- Shh! Stop talking so loud!

603
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,223
I make up my own mind.
I make my decisions.

604
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,058
Gary, there's no
Thai food here,

605
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:50,895
no Chinese, no take-out,
nothing.

606
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:52,229
Come on.

607
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:55,533
No, you're--
you're trying to trick me.

608
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:59,704
I told you,
I-I'm not leaving!

609
00:27:14,186 --> 00:27:16,654
Oh, God.

610
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:19,990
Gary!

611
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:22,359
Gary, have you seen
Skylar anywhere?

612
00:27:22,427 --> 00:27:23,827
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.
- Where?

613
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:26,063
She went into the trees.
She was looking for Zoe.

614
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,698
I was listening to the sun.

615
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:29,200
Yeah, well, if you see her,
tell her I'm looking for her.

616
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,769
Yeah, in the--okay.

617
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:40,344
Where is she?

618
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:43,346
That's not how this
is gonna work.

619
00:27:43,414 --> 00:27:46,083
90,000 volts--
that's how it's gonna work.

620
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,785
Where is she?

621
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:52,122
Hey, Doc.

622
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,728
Long time no see.
You're looking good.

623
00:27:57,795 --> 00:27:59,763
Skylar, please don't give
Mr. Scipio that instrument.

624
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:02,165
He can't be trusted.
He works for Stanton Parish.

625
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:03,733
They don't care who they hurt!

626
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,235
Come on, Doc, that any way
to talk about an old friend?

627
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:06,703
We used to have something.

628
00:28:06,771 --> 00:28:08,839
- He has Zoe.
- What?

629
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:11,408
Lee, you are the reason
why he's here.

630
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:12,709
We were safe--

631
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,314
Aah!

632
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:25,755
Doc, come on,
I'm taking that bag.

633
00:28:31,362 --> 00:28:33,196
Why did you do that?
How are we gonna find her now?

634
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:35,231
We'll find her, I promise.
We have to get out of here!

635
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,600
Go! Go!

636
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,502
We have to get to the van!

637
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:51,779
Rachel, let us know
when you hear something.

638
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,247
Stop, stop!

639
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,415
Stop the car!

640
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,151
Just let me--
just let me hear, okay?

641
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:59,687
- What, Rachel?
- Let me just listen!

642
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:05,960
I hear a child,
breathing hard.

643
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:08,930
She's scared.
There's somebody with her.

644
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,498
They're indoors.

645
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,932
All right, how far?
Where?

646
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,735
1/4 mile, that way.

647
00:29:14,803 --> 00:29:17,038
Skylar, wait, wait.
It's too dangerous.

648
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:18,239
- No.
- She'll be fine.

649
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:20,575
- It's my daughter.
- Skylar!

650
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:22,444
Skylar! Skylar!

651
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,712
Aah!

652
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:49,072
Want to do your thing?

653
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,840
Want to let them know
we're coming?

654
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:53,242
I don't think so.

655
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:01,283
Hey, want to come
do your thing?

656
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:03,485
Over on this side.

657
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,988
That open window
right up there.

658
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,056
It's all you, baby.
Yeah.

659
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,988
Do you smell that?

660
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,124
- What?
- Smell what?

661
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,192
It's a fire.

662
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,595
The forest is burning.

663
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,230
It's heading east,
towards the camp.

664
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:40,132
- That's over a mile away.
- Get in.

665
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Move.

666
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,345
- Look out!
- Run, Zoe!

667
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,547
Aah!

668
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,186
Hey! Hey!

669
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:38,221
Let me go!

670
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:39,922
Stand still!

671
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,223
Let me go!

672
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,424
Come here!
Stop!

673
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,292
Look, all we want is the kid.

674
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,162
So let me out
and give me the machine.

675
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,230
Fair trade.
Can't do it, sweetheart.

676
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,540
You're Hicks, right?

677
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,775
My sister told me
about you.

678
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,411
She said she kicked your ass
at Highland Mills.

679
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,779
That's not quite
how I remember it.

680
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,981
Oh, yeah?
Well, you'll remember this.

681
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,661
- You okay?
- Do I look okay?

682
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,263
Get me up.

683
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,064
Where is she?
Where's Zoe?

684
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,566
- Uh, she--
- Where is she?

685
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,635
She's that--
she went that way.

686
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,336
Come on, go, go, go, go.

687
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,107
Zoe!

688
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,442
Mommy's here.

689
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:12,715
Mommy!

690
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:16,085
Easy, easy.

691
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:17,453
Good. You found her.
Come on!

692
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:18,955
Let's go! Come on!
Okay.

693
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,523
We got to get out of here,
now, now!

694
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,725
All right.

695
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,799
You should've played nice.

696
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,073
No, no, no.
Get back.

697
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,641
Back, back!
Go, go, go!

698
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,243
It's okay.

699
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,912
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Don't worry, honey.

700
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,214
Don't worry.

701
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,658
There's no way we're gonna
make it out of here!

702
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,693
Zoe, you stay
with Hicks, okay?

703
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:00,163
I got her.

704
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:07,003
I can fix this.

705
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,108
Everybody, come on!
Hurry up!

706
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:14,209
Let's go! Move!

707
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:15,577
Let's keep moving here!

708
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:22,083
What are you still doing here?

709
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,584
I'm trying to help.

710
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:26,086
Dr. Rosen!

711
00:35:26,153 --> 00:35:27,654
- Gary!
- Dr. Rosen.

712
00:35:27,722 --> 00:35:29,389
My eyes are all red.
I can't see.

713
00:35:29,457 --> 00:35:30,790
- Go, get in the car.
- Come on, come on.

714
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:31,858
I'm the shotgun.

715
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:34,728
Just get in the car, okay?

716
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:37,530
Gower, go, I've got her.
I've got her.

717
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:39,966
Here you go.

718
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:45,138
Claude, what can I do?

719
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,640
Haven't you done enough?

720
00:35:51,146 --> 00:35:52,380
I need that canister.

721
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:53,447
Here you go.

722
00:35:53,515 --> 00:35:55,884
Okay, give me the hose.

723
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:57,852
All right.
Hurry.

724
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:02,224
Let me help.

725
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,794
Okay.
Here, right there.

726
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,463
You lost
213ccs of blood.

727
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:11,501
That's 7.223868 fluid ounces.

728
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,869
I rounded.

729
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,171
Yeah, I'm gonna take
your word for it, kid.

730
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,506
Take the washers.

731
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,341
- I got 'em, here.
- Okay.

732
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,476
What else?

733
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:22,612
Make sure
that connection's tight.

734
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,847
Will it work?

735
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:26,883
Do you know my mommy?

736
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:38,862
Zoe, come here.

737
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:40,397
Come on, get out of here.

738
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,031
- What about you?
- I'll be fine. Just go.

739
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,233
- Thank you!
- Go!

740
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,873
Hicks. Hicks!

741
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:52,442
Come on.

742
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:58,781
Skylar!

743
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,850
Where's Skylar?
They got out.

744
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,052
Let's get out of here.

745
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,208
Oh, he's hurt.

746
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:28,510
He's hurt.
Are you okay?

747
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:30,545
Yeah, yeah.
I stopped bleeding. I'm fine.

748
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:32,280
Ah, Doc, he's bleeding.

749
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:34,983
We stopped it.
What happened?

750
00:37:35,051 --> 00:37:37,352
We have to get him
to a hospital.

751
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,021
I'll drive.

752
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:42,424
A wildfire that broke out
earlier today

753
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:45,760
near White Mountain National
Forest is reportedly contained,

754
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:47,896
although a code orange
air-quality alert

755
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:50,398
remains in effect.

756
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:53,101
- What are you drawing there?
- A picture of us.

757
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:01,142
You're a pretty cool kid,
you know that?

758
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,377
I know.

759
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:09,318
Where's the red one?
This part needs to be red.

760
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:11,453
Maybe it fell.

761
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:19,795
Thank you.

762
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:23,932
They roll everywhere.

763
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,134
She is very talented.

764
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:31,273
Hitting on a single mom
via her kid--

765
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:32,541
it's kind of creepy.

766
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:35,677
I'm not hitting on you,
Ms. Adams.

767
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:39,181
You're far too young for me.

768
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:41,984
I'm bringing you an offer.

769
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,653
A child like Zoe--she needs
an environment

770
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,589
that she can thrive in,
as do you.

771
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,924
Who are you?

772
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:49,993
I'm Stanton Parish.

773
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,470
I believe you met some
of my colleagues recently.

774
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,739
I apologize
for their behavior.

775
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,474
They have
the unfortunate tendency

776
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,311
to get carried away.

777
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,079
What do you want?

778
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,182
To give you
an opportunity...

779
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,252
help make the world
a better place.

780
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,154
Isn't that what every mother
wants for her child?

781
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,977
- Hey.
- Hey.

782
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:45,914
Heard you had
a rough trip.

783
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:48,716
My whole world opened up.

784
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:51,852
I mean, my senses...

785
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,088
It's just--they got bigger
than ever before.

786
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:59,093
Dr. Rosen doesn't know
if I'll ever...

787
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:00,995
go back to the way I was.

788
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:06,033
I would've brought you
flowers, but...

789
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:07,234
I know the smell

790
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:08,802
would bother you, so...

791
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:13,307
What?

792
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,544
You just...

793
00:40:17,612 --> 00:40:20,179
you get me.

794
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:21,347
You really do.

795
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,621
It's weird, right?

796
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:30,624
Like, everything's turned up
so high, but...

797
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,461
I'm still here.

798
00:40:36,964 --> 00:40:38,798
Maybe...

799
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:01,720
Cam...
You could have been killed.

800
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:03,022
No.

801
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:05,324
No.

802
00:41:05,392 --> 00:41:07,392
But if it was a couple inches up
and to the right,

803
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,827
I really might've been
in trouble.

804
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,400
I'm so sorry.

805
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:17,869
Hey, it's not your fault.

806
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:19,771
Yeah.
No, I know.

807
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,340
It's just--

808
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,443
Besides, if I play
my cards right,

809
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:27,113
I just might get
medical leave.

810
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,714
You can nurse me
back to health.

811
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,154
Let me guess.

812
00:41:35,222 --> 00:41:39,326
You told Cley that machine
got burnt up in the fire.

813
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,095
Yes. A tragedy.

814
00:41:42,163 --> 00:41:45,566
He was disappointed.

815
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,968
One of these days, Doc,

816
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:50,070
crap is gonna come back
and bite you in the ass.

817
00:41:50,138 --> 00:41:51,204
You know that, right?

818
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,175
What's on your mind, Bill?

819
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:57,244
Scipio knew that
we were gonna be there.

820
00:41:57,312 --> 00:41:58,579
I know.

821
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:02,916
Someone close to us
is working with Parish.

822
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:07,655
Bill, I want you
to vet everyone.

823
00:42:07,722 --> 00:42:10,591
Cley's office,
the D.O.D. staff,

824
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:14,294
families, friends, everyone,
even Kat.

825
00:42:14,362 --> 00:42:16,696
All right, I'll bring Hicks
and Gary up to speed.

826
00:42:16,764 --> 00:42:18,064
No.

827
00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:21,601
They don't need to know.

828
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:24,837
This is just between you
and me.

829
00:42:24,905 --> 00:42:27,073
Find this person, Bill.

830
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,876
And when we do?

831
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:32,278
Just find him.
