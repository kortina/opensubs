2
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:58,086
- So long. We'll see you again.
- Goodbye.

3
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,464
Give me your money. Do it.

4
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,665
- Splendid.
- Thank you.

5
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,755
Blue 439.

6
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:26,460
- Blue 439. Over.
- <i>Blue 439, go ahead, please. Over.</i>

7
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,363
Phone weston 0-219.
Tell him I'm on my way, will you?

8
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,300
<i>Roger Wilco. Stand by.</i>

9
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:10,868
- Hello, love.
- Hello.

10
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:36,154
- Get that stuff developed, will you?
- Yeah.

11
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:38,092
Right away.

12
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,603
Here I am.

13
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:01,248
Ready?

14
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:06,751
- I've been ready for nearly an hour.
- Good.

15
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:09,686
I'm catching a plane for Paris at 11,
so I can't--

16
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,758
Can't what?

17
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,419
It doesn't matter.

18
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:23,335
Who the hell were you with last night?

19
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,672
Reg.

20
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,833
Reg, let's have some noise, can we?

21
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,817
Right.

22
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,749
That's good. That's good.
Hold that.

23
00:07:56,454 --> 00:07:58,217
Reg.

24
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:13,128
Give it to me now.
Come on. That's good.

25
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,667
Hunch. Hunch more.

26
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,034
That's it. That's good.

27
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:25,579
That's good. And the hair back.
And the hair back.

28
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,416
That's great. That's great!
That's good. More of that.

29
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,381
Now give it to me. Really give it to me.
Come on, now.

30
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,152
As fast as you can, give it to me.
Come on, right forward.

31
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:41,089
That's good. This side. This side.
Lean right forward. Hand up.

32
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,194
That's great. Just touch the face.
That's very good.

33
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:47,594
And again around this way.
Touch the face again.

34
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:50,462
Good. Now the hair.
Marvelous. That's great.

35
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:53,626
Good. Yes, the hair.
Much more. Much more.

36
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,467
Good. Yes, that's great.
That's good. Yes. And again. And again.

37
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,074
Oh, hold that.
Hold the hair back. Again. Good.

38
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,277
Okay, Reg, 50.

39
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,940
On your back. On your back. Go on.

40
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,115
Yes. Now really give it to me. Come on.

41
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,485
Come on. Work, work, work!

42
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:20,150
Great. Great. And again.
Go on. Back. Back. Arms up.

43
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:23,092
Stretch yourself, little lady. Great.

44
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:26,131
And again. Go on. Go. Go.

45
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,205
That's great.

46
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:35,239
That's it. Keep it up. Lovely.

47
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,003
Yeah, make it come. Great.

48
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,169
No, no, head up. Head up.

49
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,011
Now for me, love. For me.

50
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:48,449
Now! Now! Yes! Yes! Yes!

51
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,701
Hello?

52
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,639
Yeah, hold on.

53
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:18,741
It's Peter.

54
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:21,473
Hello?

55
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:25,242
Yes.

56
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,479
Yes.

57
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:30,452
Yeah, I've got it somewhere.
I know I have.

58
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,853
Yeah, hold on.

59
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:38,225
Reg, take down the address
of that bloody junk shop, would you?

60
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,393
Why, they're fabulous. Go on.

61
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:14,823
Yeah.

62
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,192
Yeah. Great.

63
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:23,162
Here. You can burn that lot.

64
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,225
Reg!

65
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:52,821
- Get the birds down, will you?
- Okay.

66
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:40,733
No chewing gum. Get rid of it.

67
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,773
And not on my floor.

68
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:46,377
You, arm down.

69
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:48,604
Right.

70
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,108
Six millimeter.

71
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,322
Terrible.

72
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:05,389
How about the leg
a little further forward?

73
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,292
Put the head up.

74
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,667
Just go. Mouth open.
Yes, good. Good.

75
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:53,262
No, you're all wrong. Start again.
Rethink it. Rethink it.

76
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:01,476
Stripes, let the dress just fall down.
Keep the stripes straight.

77
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:04,045
Just let your arms go up and down.

78
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:08,207
Yes, very tasty. Yes, I like it.
I like it. Go on.

79
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,117
Yeah.

80
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:12,413
All right, change position.

81
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,116
Yep.

82
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,493
Wake up!

83
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:27,489
You can thank your lucky stars
you're working with me, can't you?

84
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,569
All right, one more.

85
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,828
And let's smile now. Come on.

86
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,198
Smile.

87
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,605
Smile.

88
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,212
God.

89
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,981
I asked you to smile.

90
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,489
What's the matter?

91
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:57,527
Have you forgotten what a smile is?

92
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,595
Hey?!

93
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:11,098
All right, you're all tired now.
Go on, relax.

94
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,142
I can't see your eyeballs anymore.
They're just slits.

95
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:18,803
Go on.

96
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,448
Close your eyes.

97
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:25,176
Close your eyes.

98
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:30,756
And stay like that.

99
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:34,156
It's good for you.

100
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,840
Close your eyes.

101
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:41,777
That must be five or six years old.

102
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:50,588
They don't mean anything when I do them.
Just a mess.

103
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:57,562
Afterwards, I find something
to hang on to, like that--

104
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,169
Quite like that leg.

105
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,341
Then it sorts itself out and adds up.

106
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:14,082
It's like finding a clue
in a detective story.

107
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,111
Don't ask me about this one.
I don't know yet.

108
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,383
- Can I buy it?
- No.

109
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,322
Will you give it to me?

110
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:06,455
There.

111
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,727
Tight-faced bastard.

112
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:18,361
He won't float me one
of his crappy paintings.

113
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,644
I'll creep down one night
and knock it off.

114
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:46,421
Don't stop, it's lovely.

115
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,226
You look tired.

116
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:54,630
I've been all night in a doss house.

117
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:29,528
They say they've been asked to come here.

118
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:34,800
- Not by me.
- Well, we weren't exactly asked.

119
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,107
Sorry, I'm busy.

120
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:41,769
They're printing some snaps for me upstairs.
Go and fetch them.

121
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:49,419
Couldn't you give us just a couple of minutes?

122
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,252
A couple of minutes?

123
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,051
I haven't even got a couple of minutes
to have my appendix out.

124
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:27,183
- Well, when can we come then?
- Don't.

125
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:35,626
- The others still waiting with their eyes shut?
- Yes, they're waiting, but their eyes are open.

126
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:37,524
Good.

127
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:40,328
Tell them to shut them again.

128
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,539
Get rid of that bag. It's diabolical.

129
00:20:57,415 --> 00:21:00,577
Can we come back this afternoon?

130
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,576
- What do you want?
- Just looking around.

131
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:55,048
There are no cheap bargains here.
You're wasting your time.

132
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,381
Well, I'll just have a look.

133
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:01,183
What are you looking for?

134
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:04,691
- Pictures.
- No pictures.

135
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:11,493
What kind of pictures?

136
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,368
- Landscapes.
- Sorry, no landscapes.

137
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:31,915
Sold. All sold.

138
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:40,119
- You the owner?
- No, the owner is out.

139
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:44,256
Expecting him?

140
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,781
What are you doing?

141
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,083
Stop it! Stop it!

142
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,092
Give me those pictures.
You can't photograph people like that.

143
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:00,253
Who says I can't?

144
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm only doing my job.
Some people are bullfighters...

145
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,535
some people are politicians.

146
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,135
I'm a photographer.

147
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:12,669
This is a public place.
Everyone has the right to be left in peace.

148
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:17,236
It's not my fault if there's no peace.

149
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:21,479
You know, most girls would pay me
to photograph them.

150
00:30:22,918 --> 00:30:24,976
I'll pay you.

151
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:27,613
I overcharge.

152
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:30,621
There are other things
I want on the reel.

153
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:45,468
What do we do then?

154
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:48,536
I send you the photographs.

155
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,935
No, I want them now.

156
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,110
No!

157
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:01,308
What's the rush?

158
00:31:08,091 --> 00:31:11,218
Don't let's spoil everything.
we've only just met.

159
00:31:23,538 --> 00:31:26,506
No, we haven't met.
You've never seen me.

160
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:38,169
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:42,969
- My agent saw you about this shop.
- Did he?

162
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:45,101
He's a man with a cigar.

163
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,302
Throws ash everywhere.

164
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:50,013
I expect I remember him.

165
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:53,813
I probably asked for too much money.

166
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:56,817
Money's always a problem, isn't it?

167
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:01,950
Tell him to come back.

168
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,896
Why are you selling?

169
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:16,971
I'd like to try something different.

170
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,004
Get off somewhere.

171
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:22,109
I'm fed up with antiques.

172
00:33:22,978 --> 00:33:24,707
Get off where?

173
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,438
To Nepal.

174
00:33:28,082 --> 00:33:30,642
Nepal is all antiques.

175
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:32,376
Is it?

176
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:38,353
Perhaps I better try Morocco.

177
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,362
- How much?
- What?

178
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:51,594
The propeller.

179
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:56,235
You can have it for...

180
00:33:56,407 --> 00:33:58,773
- 8 pounds.
- Right. You're in business.

181
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:01,706
- Have you got a van?
- You can't take it now.

182
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:03,505
I must.

183
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,942
I must.

184
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:07,107
- I can't live without it.
- Hard luck.

185
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:11,220
That'll teach you to fall in love
with heavy things on Saturday mornings.

186
00:34:22,263 --> 00:34:25,164
- Is that it?
- That's it.

187
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:33,065
You can't treat it like that.
It's not a delivery van.

188
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,106
- Who cares?
- Leave it to me.

189
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,506
Something will turn up.

190
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:42,240
Yes. All right, but it better turn up today.

191
00:35:30,691 --> 00:35:33,387
Blue 439. Blue 439. Over.

192
00:35:33,928 --> 00:35:37,158
<i>439, go ahead, please. Over.</i>

193
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:39,022
Hello, this is--

194
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,329
Get me Flaxton 2-249.
Mr. Walker. Mr. Peter Walker.

195
00:35:43,503 --> 00:35:47,199
Tell him I saw the junk shop.
It's pricey, but the kid will come down.

196
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:49,807
Let him ring her right away, then...

197
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:52,472
nobody else will get it.

198
00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:56,245
<i>Roger Wilco. Stand by.</i>

199
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:05,012
<i>Blue 439. Blue 439. Over.</i>

200
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:07,656
Blue 439. Blue 439. Go ahead, echo.

201
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:11,783
<i>Blue 439, message passed. The number stored.
Your caller doesn't like it.</i>

202
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,122
Tell him to get stuffed.

203
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,164
What about all the buildings
going up around the place?

204
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:21,063
Already there are queers and poodles
in the area.

205
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:24,494
I saw some in the couple of minutes
I was there.

206
00:36:24,673 --> 00:36:29,838
- It'll go like a bomb. Over.
- <i>Blue 439. What is in the area? Over.</i>

207
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,106
- Forget it. Over.
- <i>Roger Wilco. Standing by.</i>

208
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,330
You want to use the lot?

209
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,518
Don't you like them?

210
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:18,686
They're great.

211
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:26,885
We'll use three or four.

212
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:29,162
Spread through the book?

213
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:32,058
No. All together.

214
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:34,199
Yeah.

215
00:37:38,237 --> 00:37:40,967
- And a pint.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:44,139
Which one last?

217
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,073
None of this lot.
I've got something fab for the end.

218
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:51,079
In a park. I only took them this morning.
You'll get them later today.

219
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:54,582
It's very peaceful, very still.

220
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:59,252
And the rest of the book will be pretty violent,
so it's best to end it like that.

221
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:00,855
Yes.

222
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:02,925
That's best.

223
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:05,487
Rings truer.

224
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:22,506
I'm going off London this week.

225
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,373
Why?

226
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:29,912
It doesn't do anything for me.

227
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:32,948
Yeah.

228
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,180
- I've knocked up a few captions.
- Yeah?

229
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,931
I'm fed up with those bloody bitches.

230
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:52,695
I wish I had tons of money.

231
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,838
Then I'd be free.

232
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,099
Free to do what?

233
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,433
Free like him?

234
00:39:09,151 --> 00:39:10,949
Someone we know?

235
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,072
That'll be all right.

236
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:28,658
Hello. Could you get me Frobershire 3-229, please?
I've only got a sixpence.

237
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:32,395
Park 1296.

238
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:40,868
Hello. It's me.

239
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:45,271
Weren't you supposed to be
going off to Hurley?

240
00:42:48,314 --> 00:42:52,875
Listen, stay where you are.
Call me soon at home.

241
00:43:08,731 --> 00:43:10,029
I've come--

242
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:12,532
I've come for the photographs.

243
00:43:14,304 --> 00:43:16,602
How did you manage to find me?

244
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:20,967
Do you live here?

245
00:44:12,923 --> 00:44:14,652
Drink?

246
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:28,860
What's so important about my bloody pictures?

247
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:32,232
That's my business.

248
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:47,443
The light was very beautiful
in the park this morning.

249
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,917
Those shots should be very good.

250
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:52,519
Anyway, I need them.

251
00:44:57,162 --> 00:45:01,599
My private life's already in a mess.
It would be a disaster if...

252
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,257
So what?

253
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:10,528
Nothing like a little disaster
for sorting things out.

254
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:23,048
Have you ever done any modeling?

255
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:25,944
Fashion stuff, I mean.

256
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:28,779
You've got it.

257
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,773
Hold that.

258
00:45:53,345 --> 00:45:56,371
Not many girls can stand
as well as that.

259
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:59,349
No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.

260
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:03,579
You'll get your pictures.

261
00:46:03,754 --> 00:46:05,187
I promise.

262
00:46:05,356 --> 00:46:07,755
I always keep my word.

263
00:46:08,758 --> 00:46:10,555
Come here.

264
00:46:12,362 --> 00:46:14,296
Show me how you sit.

265
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:46,088
Who is it?

266
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:51,392
Oh, yes. That's right.
Hold on a second.

267
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,568
Is it for me?

268
00:47:01,638 --> 00:47:03,266
It's my wife.

269
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:06,438
Why should I speak to her?

270
00:47:11,548 --> 00:47:14,744
Sorry, love.
The bird I'm with won't talk to you.

271
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:50,547
She isn't my wife, really.

272
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:53,677
We just have some kids.

273
00:47:55,183 --> 00:47:56,480
No.

274
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:59,586
No kids. Not even kids.

275
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:05,882
Sometimes, though,
it feels as if we had kids.

276
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:10,789
She isn't beautiful. She's...

277
00:48:11,665 --> 00:48:13,894
easy to live with.

278
00:48:18,037 --> 00:48:19,902
No, she isn't.

279
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,240
That's why I don't live with her.

280
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:53,564
But even with beautiful girls...

281
00:48:53,737 --> 00:48:56,297
you look at them, and that's that.

282
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:00,175
That's why they always end up by...

283
00:49:02,745 --> 00:49:05,543
And I'm stuck with them all day long.

284
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,778
It would be the same with men.

285
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,649
Have a listen to this.

286
00:49:32,372 --> 00:49:34,396
No. Keep still. Keep still.

287
00:49:34,574 --> 00:49:36,564
Listen and keep still.

288
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:45,042
You can smoke if you like.

289
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:50,955
Slowly. Slowly.

290
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:53,250
Against the beat.

291
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,268
That's it.

292
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:51,776
I can't stand it.
I'm nervous enough as it is.

293
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,574
Can I have some water?

294
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:47,261
And I'm not a fool, love.

295
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:58,228
Can I have the photographs?

296
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:00,107
Of course.

297
00:52:00,274 --> 00:52:02,072
Later.

298
00:52:05,245 --> 00:52:07,942
Your boyfriend's a bit past it.

299
00:52:14,855 --> 00:52:17,118
Why didn't you say what you want?

300
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,782
Get dressed.

301
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,955
I'll cut out the negatives you want.

302
00:54:55,368 --> 00:54:57,199
They'll go.

303
00:55:00,073 --> 00:55:01,871
They're not going.

304
00:55:06,713 --> 00:55:08,613
Don't go.

305
00:55:20,726 --> 00:55:23,092
- Have you bought a propeller?
- What?

306
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,291
You bought a propeller this morning, right?

307
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:28,258
Oh, yes.

308
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,792
You'll have to give us a hand with it.

309
00:55:47,284 --> 00:55:49,877
- All right?
- Fine. Yeah.

310
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,290
What's it for?

311
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,858
Nothing. It's beautiful.

312
00:55:59,028 --> 00:56:02,827
If I had a big room like this,
I'd hang it from the ceiling like a fan.

313
00:56:04,265 --> 00:56:07,496
- Do you live on your own?
- No.

314
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:17,176
Perhaps I'll put it there
like a piece of sculpture.

315
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:20,639
It'll look good there.
It'll break up the straight lines.

316
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,464
- Are you going?
- It's late.

317
00:56:45,637 --> 00:56:47,605
Do I see you again?

318
00:56:50,342 --> 00:56:54,539
Well, at least tell me your name
or your telephone number.

319
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:27,605
Thank you.

320
01:05:58,133 --> 01:06:01,034
Hello? Knightsbridge 1-239.

321
01:06:02,538 --> 01:06:04,028
What?

322
01:06:05,406 --> 01:06:07,271
No, I'm sorry.

323
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:51,948
Ron?

324
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:54,385
Something fantastic's happened.

325
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:58,327
Those photographs in the park, fantastic!

326
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:01,396
Somebody was trying to kill
somebody else.

327
01:09:01,568 --> 01:09:03,660
I saved his life.

328
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:07,065
Listen, Ron, there was a girl.

329
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:10,536
Ron, will you listen?

330
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:13,270
What makes it so fantastic--

331
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:18,275
Look, hang on, will you, Ron?
There's somebody at the door.

332
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:48,071
You weren't expecting us, were you?

333
01:09:48,578 --> 01:09:50,068
No.

334
01:10:04,892 --> 01:10:09,795
- Can you manage to make a cup of coffee?
- I can make an lrish coffee, if you'd like.

335
01:10:15,803 --> 01:10:17,703
Right, come on.

336
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:34,317
- She always like that?
- Like what?

337
01:10:34,487 --> 01:10:36,351
Doesn't speak.

338
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,858
What's your name?

339
01:10:41,827 --> 01:10:45,125
Forget it.
What's the use of her name?

340
01:10:46,297 --> 01:10:48,857
What do they call you in bed?

341
01:10:49,901 --> 01:10:52,461
I only go to bed to sleep.

342
01:11:11,153 --> 01:11:12,644
Hello?

343
01:11:17,393 --> 01:11:18,883
Hello?

344
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,669
Look at all these clothes.

345
01:11:38,647 --> 01:11:40,136
No.

346
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:46,477
- Hey, how about this one?
- Put it on.

347
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,836
What about you? Help yourself.

348
01:12:15,813 --> 01:12:17,474
The coffee!

349
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:49,272
What's happening?

350
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:12,263
- What's the matter?
- She's got a better figure than me!

351
01:13:19,573 --> 01:13:22,564
Go on, whack her.
Go on, give her the left hook.

352
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:25,310
We'll put you in the ring together.

353
01:13:32,684 --> 01:13:34,208
Oh, no!

354
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:15,188
Hold her legs!

355
01:14:15,356 --> 01:14:17,951
No! No!

356
01:14:29,602 --> 01:14:31,400
- Hold her legs!
- No!

357
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:34,301
No! No! No!

358
01:14:54,392 --> 01:14:56,587
Let go of me.

359
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:50,791
Right, let's move. Out.

360
01:16:50,966 --> 01:16:55,403
- But you haven't taken any photos.
- No, I'm too whacked.

361
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:57,504
It's your own faults.

362
01:17:10,684 --> 01:17:12,174
Tomorrow.

363
01:17:17,357 --> 01:17:18,846
Tomorrow!

364
01:28:35,846 --> 01:28:38,041
Were you looking for something just now?

365
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:41,139
No.

366
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:48,021
Do you ever think of leaving him?

367
01:28:48,191 --> 01:28:50,784
No, I don't think so.

368
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,261
I saw a man killed this morning.

369
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:00,791
Where?

370
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:02,459
Shot.

371
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:05,395
In some sort of park.

372
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,838
Are you sure?

373
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,839
He's still there.

374
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,472
Who was he?

375
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:20,109
Someone.

376
01:29:28,962 --> 01:29:30,952
How did it happen?

377
01:29:31,898 --> 01:29:34,264
I don't know, I didn't see.

378
01:29:39,838 --> 01:29:41,806
You didn't see.

379
01:29:44,209 --> 01:29:45,699
No.

380
01:29:46,611 --> 01:29:48,806
Shouldn't you call the police?

381
01:29:52,383 --> 01:29:54,181
That's the body.

382
01:30:03,193 --> 01:30:06,025
Looks like one of Bill's paintings.

383
01:30:07,163 --> 01:30:08,653
Yes.

384
01:30:24,313 --> 01:30:26,303
Will you help me?

385
01:30:26,481 --> 01:30:28,676
I don't know what to do.

386
01:30:36,823 --> 01:30:38,848
What is it?

387
01:30:44,197 --> 01:30:46,927
I wonder why they shot him.

388
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,911
I didn't ask.

389
01:31:55,562 --> 01:31:58,895
Hello, Ron?
Oh, hello, love. Is Ron there?

390
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:02,792
No, I just wanted to take him somewhere.
where is he?

391
01:32:03,936 --> 01:32:06,701
Okay, I'll fetch him there.
Bye-bye, love.

392
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:01,955
Give them the song again.

393
01:39:26,911 --> 01:39:28,640
Ron.

394
01:39:28,813 --> 01:39:30,803
Give me a minute, will you?

395
01:39:39,756 --> 01:39:41,382
Ron.

396
01:39:57,271 --> 01:39:59,933
Someone's been killed. Now, would you--?

397
01:40:01,842 --> 01:40:04,004
Okay.

398
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:07,542
Okay.

399
01:40:08,548 --> 01:40:12,348
Listen.
Those pictures I took in the park--

400
01:40:17,122 --> 01:40:19,590
I thought you were supposed
to be in Paris.

401
01:40:19,758 --> 01:40:21,316
I am in Paris.

402
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:27,326
Here. Have a drag.

403
01:40:35,341 --> 01:40:38,207
I want you to see the corpse.

404
01:40:38,376 --> 01:40:41,277
We've got to get a shot of it.

405
01:40:41,446 --> 01:40:43,676
I'm not a photographer.

406
01:40:45,883 --> 01:40:47,748
I am.

407
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:09,900
What's the matter with him?

408
01:41:18,379 --> 01:41:20,745
What did you see in that park?

409
01:41:24,853 --> 01:41:26,513
Nothing.

410
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:30,946
Ron.

410
01:41:31,305 --> 01:41:37,884
