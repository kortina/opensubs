38
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,712
Mr. Beaumont?

39
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,795
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

40
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,298
<i>7894.</i>

41
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,224
Hey, Dad.

42
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,882
Um, do you have a Detective Williams
still working here?

43
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,185
Yes, he's up in Room 221.
Right up the stairs, through that door.

44
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,557
Thanks.

45
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,161
Detective Williams?

46
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,748
Yes?

47
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,296
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
I live near you.

48
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,249
I believe you know my father,
Tom Beaumont?

49
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,550
Beaumont's Hardware Store?

50
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,175
Sure, I do. I understand he's
in the hospital. How's he doing?

51
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,177
He's okay, I guess. I hope.

52
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,634
They're doing tests.
That's why I'm home from school.

53
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,499
Anyway, I was at the hospital this morning,
and coming home through the field,

54
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,391
behind our neighborhood,
there behind Vista,

55
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,852
I, uh... found an ear.

56
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,780
You did? A human ear?

57
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,573
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.

58
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,073
Yeah, that's right.
Let's take a look at it.

59
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,329
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

60
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,149
Let's take it down to the coroner's office
and see what they make of it.

61
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,007
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

62
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,379
All right.

63
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,762
We'll check the morgue records,

64
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,216
but I don't recall anything coming in
minus an ear.

65
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,640
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

66
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,188
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

67
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,517
Well, once the tests are done,
quite a lot.

68
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,944
Sex, blood type, whether or not
the ear came off a dead person.

69
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,700
Also, it looks like the ear
was cut off with scissors.

70
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,641
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

71
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,148
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

72
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,729
Oh, Jeffrey, you're not going
down by Lincoln, are you?

73
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,907
No, I'm just gonna walk around
the neighborhood. Don't worry.

74
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,453
Okay, honey.

75
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,770
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.

76
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,355
Is Detective Williams here?

77
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,031
Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.

78
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,609
Thanks.

79
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,498
Well, now, Jeffrey, you found
something which is very interesting to us.

80
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,079
Very interesting.

81
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,165
I know you must be curious to know more.

82
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:20,302
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
not only not to tell anybody about your find,

83
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,472
but also not to ask more about the case.

84
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,471
One day when it's all sewed up,

85
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,928
I'll let you know all the details.

86
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,139
Right now, though, I can't.

87
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,848
I understand.

88
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,185
I'm just real curious, like you said.

89
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,817
I was the same way myself
when I was your age.

90
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,778
I guess that's what got me
into this business.

91
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,031
Must be great.

92
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,953
It's horrible too.

93
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,579
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

94
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,003
Anyway, I know you do understand.

95
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,089
Sure.

96
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,465
- Thanks for the card for my dad.
- Oh, you're welcome.

97
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,468
- It was nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
- You too.

98
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,082
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

99
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,147
Okay.

100
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,689
Good night, Jeffrey.

101
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,438
Good night, Detective Williams.

102
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,494
Are you the one that found the ear?

103
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,470
How did you know?

104
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,605
I just know, that's all.

105
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,237
- I remember you from Central.
- Oh, yeah?

106
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,694
- Are you a senior?
- Yup.

107
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,572
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

108
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,765
- I don't know. Boring.
- Yeah. What else is new, right?

109
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,577
Really. So what are you doin' now?

110
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,626
Uh, I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

111
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,920
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

112
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,998
So, what do you know about the ear?

113
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,819
Didn't my father tell you
not to talk about it?

114
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,800
Yeah, but you brought it up.

115
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,926
- You know anything?
- I don't know much but bits and pieces.

116
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,884
- I hear things.
- Yeah?

117
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,390
My room is right above
my father's office, so...

118
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,687
Above your father's office?

119
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,062
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

120
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,395
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

121
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,319
Hmm?

122
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,274
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

123
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,826
She lives in an apartment building
that is real close to your house.

124
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,325
It's also close to the field
where you found the ear.

125
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,328
It's a strange world, isn't it?

126
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,749
Yeah.

127
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,647
Do you know where this woman's
apartment building is?

128
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,084
Yeah. It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

129
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,235
They had her under surveillance
for a couple of months,

130
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,253
'cept I don't know what they found out
'cause she's not my dad's case, so...

131
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,682
I, uh, guess you gotta
get back home pretty soon, huh?

132
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,600
Mmm, not really. Why?

133
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,803
Well, um...

134
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,638
You wanna see the building.

135
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,348
Yeah.

136
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,434
- Come on. I'll show you.
- Okay.

137
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,448
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.

138
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,118
That's her building right there.

139
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,038
She lives on the seventh floor.

140
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,956
Come on.

141
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,604
So... uh, what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

142
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,436
I've gotta help out
at my father's hardware store.

143
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,943
They're giving me my own hours,
which is nice.

144
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,907
I used to know a kid that lived there.

145
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,488
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

146
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,701
What happened to him?

147
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,708
I don't know.

148
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,791
He moved away.
All my old friends are gone.

149
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,845
You know the chicken walk?

150
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,426
What's that?

151
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,433
That's kind of interesting.

152
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,001
- Coffee time.
- Yo!

153
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,292
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

154
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,299
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,

155
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,880
where they've always been.

156
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,762
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

157
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,765
Four.

158
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,435
I still don't know how you do that.

159
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,109
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

160
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,156
Well, if you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

161
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,073
Okeydokey, Double Ed.

162
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,779
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

163
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,685
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

164
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,354
I don't know.

165
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,773
I'd like to talk to you about something.

166
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,393
Wait just a minute.

167
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,069
Listen. Don't you guys dare
say anything to Mike, all right?

168
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,650
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, okay?

169
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,828
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

170
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,783
I don't wanna cause any trouble.

171
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,163
I'm here, aren't I?

172
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,587
- Yeah, he is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

173
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,677
You ever been to Arlene's?

174
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,924
Of course.

175
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,770
Now, are you gonna tell me why we're here?

176
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,823
There are opportunities in life

177
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,155
for gaining knowledge and experience.

178
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,084
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

179
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,816
Now, I got to thinking,
I'll bet someone could learn a lot

180
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,832
by getting into that woman's apartment.

181
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,542
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

182
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,967
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

183
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,723
Are you crazy?

184
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,847
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.

185
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,055
- This is givin' me the creeps.
- Now just settle down.

186
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,141
I have a plan which I think will work.

187
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,272
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

188
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,230
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

189
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,656
Well, you can tell me any plan you want,
but it's not going any further than this diner.

190
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,952
Sandy, don't take that attitude.

191
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,919
All right.

192
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,774
The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

193
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,256
and open a window
that I can crawl into later.

194
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,834
How are you gonna do that?

195
00:18:56,927 --> 00:19:01,592
Right out in the car I happen to have
some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.

196
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,304
I will go to her apartment.
I will be the pest-control man.

197
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,010
I will spray her apartment.

198
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,852
After a few minutes, you knock on the door,
drawing her attention away from me,

199
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,558
at which time I will then jimmy a window.

200
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,714
And what am I supposed to say
when she comes to the door?

201
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,572
You will be a Jehovah's Witness.

202
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,650
I have some <i>Awake!</i> magazines for you.

203
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,532
I don't need very much time.
Just a few seconds.

204
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,455
What do you think?

205
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,624
I don't know.

206
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,626
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

207
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,833
It's too dangerous.

208
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,465
Sandy, let's just try the first part.

209
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,260
No one will suspect us because
no one would think two people like us

210
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,641
would be crazy enough
to do something like this.

211
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,025
You have a point there.

212
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,365
Give me at least three minutes
from when I'm through the door.

213
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,498
I can stall if it's more, but I need time
to find a good window. All right?

214
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,996
All right.

215
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,207
Let's go.

216
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,596
Here I go.

217
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,853
Wait a minute. What's her name?

218
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,855
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

219
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,108
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

220
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,283
Look on her mailbox for the number,
bright boy.

221
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,162
Thanks.

222
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,948
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

223
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,827
Okay. Good luck.

224
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,121
Good luck yourself.

225
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,667
Three minutes. No sooner.

226
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,572
Yes? What is it?

227
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,745
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

228
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,492
That stuff stinks.

229
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,203
Well, this is new stuff.
There's no smell.

230
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,788
Good.

231
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,015
Just need to do the kitchen.

232
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,003
Grand Central Station.

233
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,306
It's only the bug man.

234
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,424
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

235
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,554
Are you all right?

236
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:43,764
Yeah. What happened?

237
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,895
Well, I was just about to go to the door
when that guy did my job for me.

238
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,024
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

239
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,776
I only saw his back.

240
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,094
It sounded like he went out a door
at the end of the hall.

241
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:57,532
Yeah. I didn't get a very good look
at him either, but he sure looked at me.

242
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,364
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys.

243
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,948
It's pretty nifty, huh?

244
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,375
Yeah, if they open the door.

245
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,461
Yeah.

246
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,683
So, what's next?

247
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,690
Are you game for more?

248
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,144
I owe you one since I goofed this one up.

249
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,857
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

250
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,657
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

251
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,372
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

252
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,631
Yeah. I do.

253
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,341
Well, that does that.

254
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,315
You really wanna do this, don't you?

255
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,526
I don't want you to get involved.

256
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,987
I do, but if something went wrong...

257
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,323
Like you said,
they may be involved in murder.

258
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,339
Okay. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

259
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,969
Just so the record is kept straight,
though,

260
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,304
I love Mike.

261
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,850
What do you want me to do?

262
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,521
Well, first we'll have
a really nice dinner.

263
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,476
Try to find out
where Dorothy Vallens sings.

264
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,438
I already know.
It's the Slow Club on Route 7.

265
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,990
Great. I'll pick you up about 8:00?

266
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:02,114
Uh, yeah. But don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

267
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,572
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. Okay?

268
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,158
Okay. You better get out
before someone sees us.

269
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,413
Okay.

270
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,885
See ya!

271
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,154
Wait.

272
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,582
Here's to an interesting experience, huh?

273
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,375
I'll drink to that.

274
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,125
Man, I like Heineken.

275
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,960
You like Heineken?

276
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,671
Uh, well, I never really
had a Heineken before.

277
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,757
You never had Heineken before?

278
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,093
My dad drinks Bud.

279
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,270
Ah. King of beers.

280
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,856
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

281
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,246

Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.

301
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,648
Why not?

302
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:25,105
'Cause it's crazy.

303
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,360
And dangerous.

304
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,865
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

305
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,867
I don't think you should stay here though.
I think you should go home.

306
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,744
Can you drive this car?

307
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,293
- Yeah, but I just...
- Well, leave it in front of your house for me, okay?

308
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
Okay.

309
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,548
I'll see ya tomorrow,
and I'll tell ya how it went.

310
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,969
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

311
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,885
- Mike's coming over.
- Yeah. Okay.

312
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,261
Um, can I call you?

313
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,180
Okay. Yeah, call.

314
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,472
- I hope you sneak out okay.
- Yeah.

315
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,653
I'm gonna wait here until she comes.

316
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,777
- Sandy.
- I'm gonna honk four times.

317
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:13,282
I'll go one, two, three, four,

318
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,955
and then you'll hear it,
and you'll know she's on her way up.

319
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,782
Okay.

320
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,003
I don't know if you're a detective
or a pervert.

321
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,588
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

322
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,146
See ya.

323
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,314
Bye.

324
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,416
Heineken.

325
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,656
I hope you're okay, Jeffrey.

326
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,761
Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow.

327
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,447
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

328
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,166
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?

329
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,580
Frank, let me talk to him.

330
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,257
Please, Frank... sir.

331
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,221
I like to sing "Blue Velvet."

332
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,594
Don. Don, it's all right. Don't worry.

333
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,521
Don. Don, can you hear me?

334
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,098
Is little Donny all right?

335
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,895
Is he there with you?

336
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,697
Don?

337
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,452
You mean Meadow Lane?

338
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,288
Frank! Frank, what's the matter with him?

339
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,544
I know. I'll be sweet.

340
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,881
Mommy loves you.

341
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,173
Okay, Frank, sir.

342
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,470
Oh.

343
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,475
Get out of there! Get out!

344
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,269
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

345
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:40,100
Get on your knees! Do it!

346
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,105
What are you doing?

347
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:45,233
Who are you? What's your name?
What's your name?

348
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,030
- Jeffrey.
- Jeffrey what?

349
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,575
Jeffrey nothing.

350
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,154
Give me your wallet. Give me your wallet!

351
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,712
"Jeffrey Beaumont"?

352
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,211
What are you doing in my apartment,
Jeffrey Beaumont?

353
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,800
I wanted to see you.

354
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,720
Are you kidding? Who sent you here?

355
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,219
- Nobody.
- I've seen you before.

356
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,513
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.

357
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,765
I didn't mean to do anything
except see you.

358
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,269
What did you see tonight?

359
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,850
Tell me!

360
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,152
I saw you come in.
I saw you talk on the phone.

361
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,151
- And then?
- You got undressed.

362
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,327
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

363
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,159
No, never before this.

364
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,499
Get undressed. I want to see you.

365
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,418
Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

366
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,247
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!

367
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,811
Stand up.

368
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,414
Come closer.

369
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,009
Closer.

370
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,270
What do you want?

371
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,274
I don't know.

372
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,370
Don't move. Don't look at me.

373
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,013
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

374
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,185
Don't touch me, or I'll kill you!

375
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,598
Do you like talk like that?

376
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,151
No.

377
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,064
Get over there on that couch.

378
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,241
Lie down.

379
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,093
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Go hide in the closet.

380
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,520
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

381
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,638
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

382
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,558
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

383
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,764
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

384
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,621
Now it's dark.

385
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,422
Spread your legs.

386
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,511
Wider.

387
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,814
Now show it to me.

388
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,045
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

389
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,780
Mommy.

390
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,205
Mommy! Mommy!

391
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,749
Mommy.

392
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,379
Mommy loves you, Frank.

393
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,803
Baby wants to fuck!

394
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,133
All right, get ready to fuck!

395
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,718
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

396
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,103
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

397
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,397
Yes.

398
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:16,795
Baby wants blue velvet.
I love it. I love it. I love it.

399
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,669
Mommy...

400
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:40,190
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

401
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:49,078
Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

402
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,790
Daddy's comin' home.

403
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,504
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

404
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,834
Daddy's comin' home.

405
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,272
Daddy's coming home! Daddy's coming home!

406
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,225
Daddy's coming home!

407
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,150
Mommy! Mommy!

408
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,418
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

409
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,218
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

410
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,230
Now it's dark.

411
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,871
You stay alive, baby.

412
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,296
Do it for Van Gogh.

413
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,920
Why don't you lie down?

414
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,006
Come on. I'll help you.

415
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,185
I don't like that.

416
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,934
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

417
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,684
Are you all right?

418
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,905
Yeah, I'm all right.

419
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,781
I'm all right.

420
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,533
I'll go then.

421
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,706
Don?

422
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,500
- Oh, Don!
- No.

423
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,499
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

424
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,583
I'm scared. I'm scared.

425
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,630
I'm scared.

426
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,587
It's okay. It's okay.

427
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,299
Don? Don?

428
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,682
Are you back?

429
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,531
Do you like me?

430
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,955
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

431
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,958
Do you like the way I feel?

432
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,543
Yes.

433
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,685
See my breast?

434
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,690
You can feel it.

435
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,485
My nipple... is getting hard.

436
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,447
You can touch it.

437
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,118
You can feel it.

438
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,213
Do you like the way I feel?

439
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,125
Yes.

440
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,629
Feel me.

441
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:23,639
Hit me.

442
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,729
No.

443
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,313
Dorothy, no. Stop it.

444
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,560
Hit me.

445
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,934
Hit me.

446
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,519
Hit me!

447
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,442
I'm leaving now.

448
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,028
Torned.

449
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,070
Torned.

450
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,453
Help me.

451
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,269
Oh, my God. That hat.

452
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,693
She's married.

453
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,655
"Don."

454
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,907
Help me.

455
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,001
Now it's dark.

456
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,038
Hit me. Hit me.

457
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,890
Man, oh, man.

458
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,604
- Sandy, can you talk?
<i>- Uh-uh. Mike's here.</i>

459
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,778
Oh, he is.
I guess I'll talk to you later then.

460
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,274
<i>Well, how'd it go?</i>

461
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,652
It went okay. I'll tell you about it.

462
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,233
<i>I'll pick you up at 8:00.</i>

463
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:29,287
New ax, 48721.

464
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:34,668
22.95.

465
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,416
I'll see you then.

466
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,169
<i>- Okay, great.</i>
- Bye-bye.

467
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,259
<i>Bye.</i>

468
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,838
Well?

469
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,087
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

470
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,178
Okay.

471
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,595
It's a strange world, Sandy.

472
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,608
Dorothy Vallens is married
to a man named Don.

473
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,481
They have a son.

474
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,078
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

475
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:57,326
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

476
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,453
I think she wants to die.

477
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,292
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

478
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,252
as a warning for her to stay alive.

479
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,632
Frank is a...

480
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,596
is a very dangerous man.

481
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,765
My God.

482
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,563
- Should you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

483
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,611
I can't prove any of this.

484
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:33,570
I found out my information illegally.
You could get into a lot of trouble.

485
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,991
You saw a lot in one night.

486
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,705
It is a strange world.

487
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,048
Why are there people like Frank?

488
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,093
Why is there so much trouble
in this world?

489
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,721
I don't know.

490
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,027
I had a dream.

491
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,614
In fact, it was the night I met you.

492
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:24,454
In the dream, there was our world...

493
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,338
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

494
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,886
And the robins represented love.

495
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:39,932
And for the longest time,
there was just this darkness.

496
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,938
And all of a sudden,

497
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,314
thousands of robins were set free.

498
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,693
And they flew down
and brought this blinding light of love.

499
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,444
And it seemed like that love

500
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,531
would be the only thing
that would make any difference.

501
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,284
And it did.

502
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,755
So I guess it means...

503
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,008
there is trouble till the robins come.

504
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,645
You're a neat girl.

505
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,897
So are you.

506
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,310
I mean... you're a neat guy.

507
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,907
Uh, I guess we better go.

508
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,163
Yeah. I guess so.

509
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:15,198
Hi. May I come in?

510
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,649
Yes.

511
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,532
Hurry, though.

512
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,293
Are you all right?

513
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,215
No, I'm not.

514
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:37,094
Why are you here?

515
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,593
- What do you want?
- I, uh...

516
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:44,264
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

517
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,398
It's crazy, I know.

518
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,521
I don't know where you come from, but...

519
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,020
I like you.

520
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,866
It's not crazy. I like you too.

521
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,240
I liked being with you last night.

522
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,618
Same here.

523
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,089
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

545
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,916
13, 14, 15,

546
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:44,000
16, 17, 18, 19, 20...

547
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,381
- Keep going.
- Sandy?

548
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,885
- ...23, 24, 25!
- All right.

549
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:53,559
Oh, great.

550
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,138
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

551
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,684
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?

552
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,897
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.

553
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:08,779
- Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.
- Okay.

554
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,236
One!

555
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,120
See that clock on the wall?

556
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:23,998
Yeah.

557
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:27,802
Five minutes from now, you're not
gonna believe what I've told you.

558
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,217
Number one:

559
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,475
<i>Today I staked out Frank's place
with a camera.</i>

560
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:42,482
<i>Now, there's another man
involved in all this.</i>

561
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,526
<i>I call him the Yellow Man.</i>

562
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,606
<i>You saw his back the other day
at Dorothy's apartment.</i>

563
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:54,492
<i>Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.</i>

564
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,498
Now, the only trouble is,
what does that prove?

565
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:02,370
Nothing, really, but it's interesting.

566
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,339
Number two:

567
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:10,754
I saw the Yellow Man come out
and meet up with a well-dressed man

568
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,679
carrying an alligator briefcase.

569
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,209
They went to this factory building
downtown,

570
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,490
stood on a staircase
and looked off in the distance.

571
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:40,457
Now get this.
In the distance, there was a murder.

572
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:44,204
<i>This drug dealer was shot to death
and a woman had her legs broken.</i>

573
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,789
<i>Jeffrey.</i>

574
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:53,804
Then these two guys told me that the police
would find a huge amount of drugs

575
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,426
in the dead dealer's place.

576
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,385
I can't believe what you're finding out.

577
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,471
Are you gonna continue with this?

578
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,733
Yeah.

579
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:09,646
Until when? I mean,
what are you gonna do with this stuff?

580
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,526
Well, I don't know.

581
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,410
You're not going back to her apartment?

582
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,329
Yeah.

583
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,491
Jeffrey, why?

584
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,919
I'm seeing something
that was always hidden.

585
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:34,591
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.

586
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,843
And it's all secret.

587
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,176
You like mysteries that much?

588
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,307
Yeah.

589
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,391
You're a mystery.

590
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,818
I like you... very much.

591
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,575
Oh, yeah?

592
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,216
Jeffrey. Don't, please.

593
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,848
You worry about me, really?

594
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,191
Yeah.

595
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,189
Is that so surprising?

596
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,530
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

597
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,319
I got you into this.

I want you to hurt me.

622
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:35,227
No. I don't want to hurt you.
I told you, I want to help you.

623
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,070
Dorothy, I know some of what's happening.

624
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,820
Frank has your husband and son,
doesn't he?

625
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,945
Dorothy, you gotta do something...
go to the police or...

626
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,452
No police.

627
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,159
No police.

628
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,085
Don! Hit me!

629
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,583
No! No!

630
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,665
Get away! Get away from my bed!

631
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:58,966
Get away!

632
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,280
I have your disease in me now.

633
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,849
He used to make me laugh.

634
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,603
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

635
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,356
I should go.

636
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,861
Yes.

637
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,370
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

638
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,495
I want you to stay.

639
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:18,920
Don't hate me.

640
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:21,623
Oh, I sure don't hate you.

641
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:23,380
I'm not crazy.

642
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,800
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

643
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,840
That's good.

644
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,851
You're my special friend.

645
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,775
I still have you inside of me.

646
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,853
It helps me.

647
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,526
I need you.

648
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:50,240
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

649
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,993
- Soon?
- Mmm.

650
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,494
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

651
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,167
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

652
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,176
Hello, baby.

653
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,216
Who is this fuck?

654
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,716
A friend. He's from the neighborhood.

655
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,304
We were just talking.

656
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,013
Oh.

657
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,732
You're from the neighborhood.

658
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,314
Yeah.

659
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,020
You're a neighbor.

660
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,324
Well, what's your name, neighbor?

661
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,026
Jeffrey.

662
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,112
He's a good kid, Frank.

663
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,073
Shut the fuck up!

664
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,079
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

665
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,039
No, thanks.

666
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,001
"No, thanks"? Wh-What does that mean?

667
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,461
- I don't want to go.
- Go where?

668
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:54,016
- For a ride.
- A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

669
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,808
Okay. Let's go.

670
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:02,229
Hey. Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

671
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,729
Raymond?

672
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,982
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

673
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,734
Joyride.

674
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,577
All right, where do you want to go?

675
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:27,632
Oh, I know. We got to go to Ben's, right?

676
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,550
Oh, right. We've got to see Ben.

677
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,172
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

678
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:35,178
We may all be killed.

679
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,187
He's a pussy, Frank. He's a pussy.

680
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,108
Yeah, but he's our pussy. Right, Tits?

681
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,401
Pussy heaven.

682
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,571
- You ever been to pussy heaven?
- No.

683
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:53,446
- Wh-What'd he say?
- No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

684
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,206
Ooh! Po-lice call. Po-lice call.

685
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,249
Bury that fuck!

686
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:06,376
This... is... it.

687
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:09,801
Raymond?

688
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,635
Thank you, Raymond.

689
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,476
Oh.

690
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,722
Frank's here.

691
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,813
Come on.

692
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,737
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

693
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:34,407
Hey, Raymond?
You get enough beer for Ben too.

694
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,655
- What kind of beer do you like?
- Heineken.

695
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,659
Heineken? Fuck that shit!

696
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,240
Pabst Blue Ribbon!

697
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:47,375
Hey-hey! I brought some friends.

698
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,081
I brought some beer.

699
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,462
Fine, Frank, fine.

700
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,589
Hey. Oh.

701
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:03,387
Oh, Frank. This is a fine surprise
that you brought your friends.

702
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:06,394
I love surprises.

703
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,100
Please, sit down.

704
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,736
Suave.

705
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,986
Goddamn, you are one suave fucker.

706
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,703
- You want some beer?
- Of course, Frank.

707
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:20,789
Darling.

708
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,660
Darling, could you bring some glasses?

709
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:29,667
And we'll have a beer with Frank.
Thank you.

710
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,082
Please, sit down.

711
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,509
Shit, man. How the shit are you?

712
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,883
Fine, Frank, fine. How are you?

713
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:44,516
Fuckin' good. I'm real fuckin' good.

714
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,562
A candy-colored clown.

715
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,561
Here today...

716
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,317
gone tomorrow.

717
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,819
That doesn't scare me.

718
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,500
I'm Paul. What's your name?

719
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,577
Jeffrey.

720
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,848
Where's the glasses?

721
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,596
That beer's gonna get warm.

722
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:27,771
One thing I can't fuckin' stand is warm beer!
It makes me fuckin' puke!

723
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:31,146
It's all right.
Darling, where's the glasses?

724
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,852
Here, Frank. Here come the glasses.

725
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,233
See, here are the glasses.

726
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,861
Raymond, where's the fuckin' beer, man?

727
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,614
It's right here, Frank.

728
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:46,323
- Do you want me to pour it?
- No, I want you to fuck it!

729
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:49,125
Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer!

730
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,707
There you go.

731
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:58,551
Thank you.

732
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,253
Let's drink up.

733
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,511
- Here's to your health.
- Shit, let's drink to somethin' else.

734
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:07,014
Let's drink to fucking.

735
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,808
Yeah, say, "Here's to your fuck, Frank."

736
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,939
If you like, Frank.

737
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:18,022
Here's to your fuck. Cheers.

738
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,951
Cheers. Wow. Suave, man.

739
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,787
You are so fuckin' suave.

740
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,828
- Hey, we love Ben.
- We love Ben.

741
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,913
- Here's to Ben!
- Here's to Ben.

742
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,456
Hey, neighbor.

743
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:39,835
Here's to Ben.

744
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,013
- Here's to Ben.
- Be polite!

745
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,185
Here's to Ben.

746
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,472
See that, Ben?

747
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,768
I can make him do anything I please.

748
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:06,366
Thank you for the toast.
That was very nice, neighbor.

749
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:09,456
Did he hurt your little face?

750
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,037
That feel better?

751
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,585
Hey.

752
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:21,259
Frank, I have something for you.

753
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,505
Would you excuse us all
for a moment, please?

754
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:27,090
Excuse us, <i>por favor.</i>

755
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,927
Raymond, do a little babysitting.

756
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,110
I'm Paul.

757
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:01,174
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad daylight,
of course, 'cause he's the man, right?

758
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:05,337
And he took all those drugs away,
and it was fuckin' beautiful.

759
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:10,058
A candy-colored clown
they call the Sandman.

760
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,385
For me.

761
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,559
Uh, let Tits see her kid, huh?

762
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:33,540
A candy-colored clown

Let's get on with it! Bye, Ben.

793
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:37,489
Anyone, uh, wanna go on a joyride with us?

794
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,825
How 'bout you? Huh?

795
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:42,911
Hey.

796
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,621
No smile for Frank?

797
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:46,874
No?

798
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,218
Okay, fuck it! Let's go!

799
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:55,182
You want to go with Raymond? Come on.

I'll see you Tuesday, Frank.

801
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,392
Right, Ben.

802
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,310
Now it's dark.

Where are we going, Frank?

806
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:39,426
I'm takin' your neighbor
out to the fuckin' country.

807
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:44,272
Hey, do you like to walk?

808
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:47,317
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, shithead.
- What?

809
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,895
He said "What?" Frank.

810
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,609
"What?"

811
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:01,372
Hey! What has this fuck
got to do with anything?

812
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:05,084
Jesus, goddamn.

813
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,043
You fuck!

814
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,671
What are you looking at?

815
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,844
Nothing.

816
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,641
Don't you look at me, fuck!

817
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:25,097
I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.

818
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,379
You're like me.

819
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:57,629
Oh, look at those.

820
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,555
What are these?

821
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,304
Please, Frank.
Please, Frank, let's go. Please.

822
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,761
Don't say "please," fuckhead!

823
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:11,352
Ooh, baby.
Ooh, baby wants to pinch them.

824
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,903
Ooh. Ooh.

825
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,606
What's the matter? Ooh. Ooh.
Give 'em back.

826
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,534
Ooh. Ooh. What's the matter?
They're just a little red, that's all.

827
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,988
Ooh, just let me feel 'em.
Oh, come here. Mmm.

828
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,242
Hey, leave her alone!

829
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:33,502
Oh, damn!

830
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:35,468

831
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,044
You! Out of the car, fuck!

832
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:41,055
Get him out of the car, Raymond!

833
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,514
- Frank! Frank! He didn't mean anything!
- Shut up! Shut up.

834
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:05,413
Pretty, pretty. Pretty, pretty.

835
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:10,413

<i>Things got a little out of hand.</i>

01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:57,789
I know some things. They could help
your father, but you might get into trouble.

893
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:01,333
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.

894
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:04,037
Okay.

895
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,666
I promise I won't mention you.

896
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:09,960
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.

897
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,970
Good. I'll see you Friday, if not before.

898
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:14,263
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Good.

899
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,056
- Bye-bye, Sandy.
<i>- Bye.</i>

900
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:34,863
- I don't want to talk about it.
- But...

901
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,491
Everything is okay now.

902
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,368
I just don't want to talk about it.

903
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:42,575
But sometimes
it's good to talk things over, Jeffrey.

904
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:44,706
For instance,
they say that many marriages...

905
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:47,004
Aunt Barbara...

906
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,922
I love you, but you're gonna get it.

907
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,448
Gordon.

908
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:26,627
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad daylight,
of course, 'cause he's the man, right?

909
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:30,923
And he took all those drugs away,
and it was beautiful.

910
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:05,992
I got it.

911
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:11,122
- Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Jeffrey?

912
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,126
Hi, Sandy.

913
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,427
Hi, Jeffrey.

914
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,550
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to talk to you.

915
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,849
Okay. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.

916
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,598
- Yeah.
- Come on into my study.

917
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:33,102
I have to show you some photos
and tell you some things about them.

918
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,449
This is the first picture.

919
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,407
It's Frank Booth.

920
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:47,078
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

921
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:50,245
His address is on the back of the photo.

922
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:55,959
This photo is of Frank and another man
as they went into Frank's building.

923
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:18,611
And then that man came out
and met with a third man.

924
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,192
This well-dressed guy. Here's that photo.

925
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:29,534
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

926
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,375
I think Frank kidnapped
her husband and son.

927
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,047
I have no hard proof of any of this.

928
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:41,178
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.

929
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:47,059
Who else knows you have these photos?

930
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:49,387
Just you and the photo lab.

931
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:54,063
- And you're through with this business now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

932
01:32:57,822 --> 01:33:00,109
For now, all right, you better be.

933
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,692
And Sandy better not be
involved with this, I can tell you.

934
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:10,741
Be prepared to come in
for further interrogation on this later.

935
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:13,539
Yes, sir.

936
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:24,505
Is everything okay?

937
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:27,342
Yeah. Is Friday still on?

938
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,053
- You didn't tell him about me?
- No.

939
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:34,891
Why did I ever get you going on this,
Jeffrey?

940
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:42,198
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See you then.

941
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,818
Good night, Detective Williams.

942
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,163
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.

943
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,928
Dad?

944
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:06,471
What's wrong?

945
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,055
There'd better be nothing wrong.

946
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,572
Looks like it's straight.

947
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:12,370
- Okay. I'll get it.
- Okay, thanks.

948
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,731
- Good evening, Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs. Williams.

949
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:20,542
- She's all ready.
- Okay.

950
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,421
You look great.

951
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,001
Thanks.

952
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,262
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.

953
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:30,931
- You all set?
- Almost.

954
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:32,933
Hey, John, get a move on.

955
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,020
Just a minute, Tom.

956
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:45,313
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

957
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:48,444
Behave yourself.

958
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:50,494
Don't blow it.

959
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:54,283
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

960
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,699
So long, Jeffrey.

961
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:59,376
- You two have a nice time tonight, okay?
- Okay.

962
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:01,124
What's going on?

963
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,581
Just a little fatherly advice.

964
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:05,758
That's right, Jeffrey.

965
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:07,584
Come on.

966
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,762
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

967
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,179
Good night, Mom.

968
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:13,428
Bye. Have a good time.

969
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:14,850
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.

970
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,814
Jeffrey, what was that all about?

971
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:26,020
It's nothing.

972
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:28,401
Really.

973
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:31,283
It's good to see you.

974
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:34,074
It's good to see you.

975
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,627
You look beautiful.

976
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:47,044
Thank you.

977
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,550
Hi.

978
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:03,978
Just a minute.

979
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,488
- Lookin' good!
- Thank you.

980
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:23,411
- It's all taken care of.
- Okay.

981
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:26,668
Um, you want something to drink?

982
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,334
Want to dance?

983
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:33,796

- Bye.
- Good night.

1001
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:14,668
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

1002
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:18,589
They're gonna hit us.

1003
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:22,347
- Oh, my God, what's wrong?
- It's Frank.

1004
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:30,726
Move it!

1005
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:32,853
Hang on.

1006
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:37,904
I can't outrun this guy.

1007
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,983
- My father's got a gun at home.
- Jeffrey, no.

1008
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:42,943
Sandy, this guy's a killer, I promise you.

1009
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,621
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike. Oh, my God.

1010
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:52,754
Oh.

1011
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:57,798
Whoo! Get him, Mike!

1012
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:02,968
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!

1013
01:41:04,225 --> 01:41:07,514
You stole my girl, you bastard.
Now I'm gonna kick your ass. Come on!

1014
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:10,266
Right here, right in front
of your own stupid house.

1015
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:12,723
- Get outta here!
- Mike, stop it.

1016
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:14,729
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?

1017
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:17,232
Nobody's talkin' to you, all right?

1018
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,904
- Come on.
- Mike, look, I don't wanna cause any problems.

1019
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:23,512
Who's that, huh? Is that your mother?
That your mother?

1020
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:24,846
- Dorothy.
- That your mother, Jeffrey?

1021
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:27,224
- No, come here, you Ivy League shit.
- I gotta take care of someone who's hurt,

1022
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:28,739
in case you didn't notice.

1023
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:29,869
Dorothy Vallens?

1024
01:41:38,843 --> 01:41:40,880
Come on.

1025
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:52,726
I'm really... Hey, I... I'm sorry.

1026
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:56,308
I'm really sorry.

1027
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:59,019
- I di... I didn't know. I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1028
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:01,609
I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

1029
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,361
We've gotta get her out of here.

1030
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:06,740
Take her to my house. My father can
get an ambulance faster than anyone.

1031
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:08,866
His partner won't be there, will he?

1032
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,948
- No, probably not. Why?
- Nothing.

1033
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:13,375
Watch out for Mike.

1034
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,078
Oh, God.

1035
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:19,881
Is that you, Jeffrey?

1036
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:21,799
Yeah. It's me.

1037
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:23,377
Oh, Jeffrey.

1038
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,046
Jeffrey.

1039
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:35,309
Dad? Mom?

1040
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:38,358
- I'm in here, honey.
- Mom?

1041
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:40,652
All right, I'll be right there.

1042
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,775
Is Dad home?

1043
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:45,198
No. He oughta...

1044
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:48,277
You better call him.
And, uh, get an ambulance.

1045
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:49,782
Where have you been?

1046
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:52,907
Oh, God.

1047
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,117
Oh, God, they've hurt him.

1048
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:58,079
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

1049
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,733
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's okay, it's okay.

1050
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:02,124
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. Shh. It's okay.

1051
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,471
My secret lover.

1052
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,594
I've called for an ambulance,
and the police are on their way.

1053
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:15,600
Don't get the police!

1054
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:18,640
Stop it!

1055
01:43:19,402 --> 01:43:21,485
I love you! Love me!

1056
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:27,032
He put his disease in me.

1057
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:31,366
Tell me it's all right
I opened myself to you.

1058
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:35,995
- Tell me it's all right. It's all right.
- Sandy, please.

1059
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:37,292
Sandy?

1060
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:39,586
I'll get a coat to put on her.

1061
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:45,296
Jeffrey?

1062
01:43:45,386 --> 01:43:48,003
- What's going on here?
- I'll tell you.

1063
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:52,470
They... They've hurt his head.

1064
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:54,851
Who, Dorothy?

1065
01:43:56,188 --> 01:43:58,350
Don.

1066
01:43:58,441 --> 01:43:59,932
Help him.

1067
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:02,809
Help him.

1068
01:44:04,321 --> 01:44:06,358
Promise me you'll help him!

1069
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,236
Okay.

1070
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:19,584
He put his disease in me.

1071
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:41,084
Would you like to come with us
in the ambulance or take your own car?

1072
01:44:41,108 --> 01:44:42,940
I'll be right with you.

1073
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:52,988
I should go.

1074
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:54,785
- Go.
- Sandy.

1075
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:05,998
Hold me! I'm falling!

1076
01:45:06,091 --> 01:45:08,879
I'm falling! Hold me!

1077
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:17,342
You lied to me.

1078
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:20,929
<i>Sandy, please, forgive me.</i>

1079
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,265
<i>I love you.</i>

1080
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:26,025

1081
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:33,533
I love you.

1082
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:39,789
God, I love you.

1083
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:43,998
I-I...

1084
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,421
But I couldn't watch that.

1085
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:54,922
- Is she okay?
<i>- Yeah, she's okay.</i>

1086
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:56,677
<i>Listen, get ahold of your father.</i>

1088
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:01,599
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.

1089
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:03,931
<i>- Jeffrey, no.</i>
- I have to.

1090
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,858
- I love you.
<i>- Oh, God, be careful.</i>

1091
01:46:07,945 --> 01:46:09,402
I will. Believe me.

1092
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:23,037
Where is...

1093
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,205
Where is my dream?

1094
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,266
Look, this is an emergency.

1095
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:49,021
He said someone was hurt,

in Dorothy Vallens' apartment.

Frank is on his way up here
in the well-dressed-man disguise.

01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:02,627
I've got no way out. He...

1121
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:04,878
He's got a radio.

1122
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,756

Detective Williams?

1124
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:17,429
I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Please hurry.

1125
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,284
Hey, neighbor.

1126
