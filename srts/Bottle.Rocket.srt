2
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:42,728
Hey, Dr. Nichols, I was just
coming down to say good-bye.

3
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,859
Anthony, I came to help you
with your bags.

4
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:48,200
That's okay. I can take 'em
down myself. I got 'em.

5
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:50,240
What's-- What's this?

6
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:52,775
What's going on?

7
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:59,913
Well, see, my friend Dignan didn't
realize this was a voluntary hospital...

8
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:03,214
and he got this whole
escape thing worked out.

9
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:05,551
He just got
so excited about the thing...

10
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:08,614
I didn't have the heart
to tell him...

11
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:11,217
no, that--

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,434
Look how excited he is.

13
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,203
I gotta do it this way, Dr. Nichols.
I gotta climb out.

14
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:29,040
It's only one floor down.

15
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:31,706
Okay. But can you do it fast?

16
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:36,481
You know, this doesn't look good.
None of this looks good at all.

17
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:39,249
Well, thanks very much, Dr. Nichols.

18
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:42,918
You've really been a great help.
You've been a great doctor.

19
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:45,518
Well, thank you.

20
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:49,098
Can you hand me my bag, please?

21
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:55,100
See ya.

22
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:58,107
Hey, Anthony, don't try
to save everybody, okay?

23
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:00,143
Okay, I won't.

24
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,538
Dennis!

25
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:10,579
- See ya later, Felicia.
- Hey, Anthony. Thanks for everything.

26
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:13,088
- Good-bye. Take care.
- Bye, Barbara.

27
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:15,590
- See ya, Chris.
- Thanks, Anthony.

28
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,186
Come on. Any problems?
Yes! Wonderful.

29
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:21,458
Wait, wait.
Who'd you get to do that?

30
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,399
Did you bribe the janitor?
Smart.

31
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:35,478
- Driver, what's our E. T. A. ?
- 7:30.

32
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,344
Good. We're on schedule. Here's
our agenda for the next few months.

33
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:41,475
- You'll find everything is in order.
- Practice job. Looks good.

34
00:03:41,552 --> 00:03:45,181
That's our first move when we get back.
Look it over. I'll brief you on the way.

35
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:49,385
This is what I was trying to do.

36
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,450
The practice job, a heist.

37
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:53,723
You and I both respond to goals.

38
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:55,924
- It all leads to Mr. Henry.
- The guy from the letters.

39
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,399
Exactly. This is rough.

40
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:01,130
You and I respond to structure...

41
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:04,002
and that's what's important.

42
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,065
"The next 50."

43
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:11,940
So, did you enjoy your first
visit to the nuthouse?

44
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:15,007
Come on. Be sensitive to the fact
that other people...

45
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:18,418
are not comfortable talking
about emotional disturbances.

46
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:22,858
You know I am. I'm fine with that.
But other people--

47
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:25,292
Put it behind you.
You're out. You're better.

48
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:28,331
- You're right.
- And so it begins.

49
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:31,959
Now, we should also get on a fitness
regime-- sit-ups, hitting the bags--

50
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,560
I was running ten miles a day
when I was in the desert.

51
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:38,699
Were you really?
That's good cardiovascular.

52
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,608
When did you get so avid
about the fitness thing, Dignan?

53
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:44,943
What? What do you mean by avid?

54
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:47,779
I've never known you
to be all that athletic.

55
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:50,012
You've never known me
to be all that athletic?

56
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:52,988
- Does it sound weird?
- Not that you're not a good athlete.

57
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:56,457
- Does it sound weird to talk about it?
- It doesn't sound weird.

58
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,859
I'm not saying it's the top priority,
but I think it's a good goal.

59
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,195
- I think it's a really good goal.
- Here, put these on.

60
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,374
- Obviously, good quickness.
- Yeah, in and out pretty fast.

61
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,747
- Real fast, and good intensity.
- High intensity.

62
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:57,048
Great, 'cause
I was like really fast.

63
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,953
The preparation was good.
I think that's your specialty.

64
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:03,789
If I said that, it would sound
like bragging. Okay, criticisms.

65
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,886
- Criticisms.
- I've only one: not very thorough.

66
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:09,659
- Left a lot of valuables.
- I don't think that was a mistake.

67
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:13,225
That was one of the limitations
of this job.

68
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,567
By the way, great job in there.

69
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,506
- It was nice working with you, 'cause--
- Thank you.

70
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,535
Next order of business: Mr. Henry.

71
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:26,241
You're probably wondering when
I'm going to introduce you to Mr. Henry.

72
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:29,808
In answer to that question, very soon.
In fact, judging from how well that--

73
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:31,877
Here you go.
You gotta do that.

74
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:34,253
Judging from how well
that job went today...

75
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,121
including the coins and earrings...

76
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,184
was, to say the least--

77
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,727
You took the earrings, Dignan?
You took 'em?

78
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:50,867
Well, it's my fault. Ultimately,
Anthony, when are you gonna learn?

79
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:54,502
Man, you got another ball!
Should I play your game?

80
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:57,570
I know you remember the list,
'cause you signed it.

81
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:00,411
"The things Dignan's
not supposed to touch."

82
00:07:00,484 --> 00:07:03,715
I can't be sorting through all that shit
in the middle of a burglary.

83
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:07,746
Hey, I don't care, okay? I bought
the earrings for my mother's birthday.

84
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:09,917
I went down,
I picked 'em out myself.

85
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:13,224
Hey, one thing is, every valuable item
in the house was on that list.

86
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:15,856
Maybe we should've robbed your house.
Did you ever think of that?

87
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:18,423
I bet that never crossed your mind.

88
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,904
What? What? Come on, Dignan!

89
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:24,907
You know there's nothing
to steal from my mom and Craig.

90
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,352
Hey, Grace!

91
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:48,822
You're supposed to be in Arizona.

92
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,094
What, you don't say hi anymore?
Come on.

93
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,398
Is this the--
Are you the pilot?

94
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,234
No, I'm Anthony.
I'm Grace's brother.

95
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:59,036
Will you excuse us
for a minute, Bernice?

96
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:01,441
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

97
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,715
You told her--

98
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:09,775
You told your friend Bernice
I'm some kind of jet pilot?

99
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:13,380
What was I supposed to say,
they stuck you in an insane asylum?

100
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:17,790
It wasn't an insane asylum, Grace.
I explained it was for exhaustion.

101
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:19,658
Exhaustion?

102
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,424
Yes, exhaustion.

103
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:25,628
You haven't worked a day in your life.
How could you be exhausted?

104
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:27,829
Okay, sit down. Okay?

105
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:31,840
I didn't come up here today
to argue with you, okay?

106
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,746
- I got some friends waiting for me--
- Who?

107
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:41,009
- Some associates.
- Dignan?

108
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:45,119
Yeah, Dignan, but also--

109
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:48,855
What's wrong with Dignan, Grace?
I thought you liked Dignan.

110
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:51,826
- I do like Dignan.
- Then why did you sigh?

111
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,419
But he's a liar.

112
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:53,530
Bob Mapplethorpe,
potential getaway driver, go!

113
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,192
Bob Mapplethorpe,
potential getaway driver, go!

114
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,660
- Go.
- There's an air of mystery about me.

115
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:03,001
Don't complicate it. Your strength is
you have a car you can provide.

116
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:06,372
Sell yourself. Start over.
You ready? Go.

117
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:09,207
Okay. All right.
I'm a risk taker.

118
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,976
I'm growin' an entire crop of marijuana
plants in my parents' back yard.

119
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:16,541
Wait a second. You're growing an entire
crop of marijuana in your back yard?

120
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,851
Dignan, look. I'm just not that good
at this selling yourself stuff, okay?

121
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:22,221
So I'm just
gonna tell you the truth.

122
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,954
I really want to be
a part of this team...

123
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,963
and I'm the only one
with a car.

124
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,860
That's good.

125
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,230
'Cause that hits me right here.

126
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:37,967
Okay, can you do me a favor
and take--

127
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,444
I want you to take these earrings
and put them in Mom's mahogany box.

128
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:46,539
- Put them in your backpack.
- What are you doing with these?

129
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,982
Could you just put them
in the box, please, Grace?

130
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:53,751
You've really gotten into the bad habit
of asking a huge amount of questions.

131
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,592
God.

132
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:00,758
I gotta go, okay, pal?

133
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,128
What's gonna happen to you, Anthony?

134
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,101
Geez, Grace, what the hell
kind of question is that to ask me?

135
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,104
When are you coming home?

136
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:17,070
Grace, I can't come home.
I'm an adult.

137
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:24,682
Why you looking at me
like that? Huh?

138
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:27,848
When I was little, I wanted to know
what caused thunder--

139
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:31,257
How'd it go with Grace?
How'd it go?

140
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:33,353
- Can we leave, please, Bob?
- Sure.

141
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:38,362
Little kids are really cute.
She is a cute little kid.

142
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:42,963
What happened? I just have no idea.
I mean, how did Grace get so cynical?

143
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,805
I can't answer that now. My only concern
is getting you back in the car.

144
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:50,039
- She's come to this conclusion--
- Get back in the car where you can--

145
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:55,050
- She thinks I'm a failure.
- What? She said you were a failure?

146
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:57,348
What has she ever accomplished
with her life?

147
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,888
- What do I do?
- You don't have to do anything.

148
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:02,823
I'm not saying that
she has to look up to me at all.

149
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:06,293
- Don't worry about it.
- Maybe she should. Why not?

150
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:10,299
- She told her friend I was a pilot.
- Stop for a second and look at this.

151
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:13,200
- Oh, no.
- Fact: I learned more...

152
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:15,362
in the two months
I spent with Mr. Henry...

153
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:18,066
than I learned in 15 years
of academic study.

154
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:21,076
Fact: I can guarantee you,
after Mr. Henry sees us pull this job...

155
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:23,840
he's gonna take a personal interest
in our future.

156
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:26,074
Fact: Mr. Henry
drives a Jaguar.

157
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,777
Fact: The picture's
not doing it for me right now.

158
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:32,049
Well, does the fact that
I'm trying to do it do it for you?

159
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:34,147
I hate to interrupt
your conversation, guys...

160
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:36,954
but I think I know
what you've been going through...

161
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,461
'cause I've been through
some pretty heavy shit myself.

162
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,362
If you're feeling alone,
like nobody in the world cares...

163
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:45,924
and nobody in the fucking world
gives a shit, then I'm here.

164
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:48,163
- That was a stop sign.
- I'm ready to listen, man.

165
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:50,172
If you want,
I'll even open up first.

166
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,540
My brother-- That's a shit situation.
He beats the crap out of me always.

167
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:04,479
I don't suppose either of you know
why Bob's car is parked out front.

168
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:07,114
Yeah, he's here.

169
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,249
- He's ins--
- He's here at the house.

170
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:11,259
Let me see if Bob's
keeping the pool clean.

171
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:13,454
- That's Future Man.
- Yeah, I know.

172
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,034
What the fuck is this?

173
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:24,329
Vamonos, Clay. Bob, you were told to
thoroughly clean the pool this morning.

174
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,341
- It's a leaf.
- It was one leaf!

175
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,845
Your name's Anthony, isn't it?

176
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:32,643
Yeah, his name's Anthony.
My name's Dignan.

177
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:35,684
I'm Stacy Sinclair,
Elizabeth's sorority sister.

178
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:38,846
I didn't know
she had a sister.

179
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:41,857
Oh, my God.
You have the best sense of humor.

180
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:45,190
She is going to be so jealous
I saw you here.

181
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:48,492
So, you go to school
in Arizona, right?

182
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:52,433
- No, I was in the hospital.
- Oh, what for?

183
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:57,635
I went nuts.

184
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:01,040
- He's kidding. He didn't go nuts.
- You poor thing. How'd it happen?

185
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:04,672
- Do you really wanna know?
- Yes, I really do.

186
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:11,214
One morning
over at Elizabeth's beach house...

187
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:15,951
she asked me if I'd rather
go water skiing or lay out.

188
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:20,587
And I realized that not only did I
not want to answer that question...

189
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:24,565
but I never wanted to answer
another water-sports question...

190
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:28,126
or see any of these people again
for the rest of my life.

191
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:33,130
Three days later I was on my way
out to the desert, and that was that.

192
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,204
Bullying son of a bitch!

193
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,613
You're calling me a bully?
Here's a bully for ya!

194
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:45,821
Hold on, Bob! You're only
gonna make this take longer!

195
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,948
You're really complicated,
aren't you?

196
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:50,720
- My ear!
- I try not to be.

197
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:33,201
Okay, escape route is crucial...

198
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:36,705
in case somebody is tailing us
or even chasing us, as the case may be.

199
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,037
We can't be sure
how it is gonna happen.

200
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,303
Do you think
we're gonna be chased?

201
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:44,369
That's a good question.
No, I don't think we're gonna be chased.

202
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:47,575
I'm just being hypocritical here.
However, I will say--

203
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,711
Bob, please don't interrupt me, man,
'cause I'm trying to stay focused.

204
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:56,157
You're responsible for the external
situation, streets and the getaway.

205
00:14:56,226 --> 00:15:00,128
Excuse me. Are the explosives
really necessary here?

206
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:03,529
I think it would be a lot more simple if
I just walked up to the door alone.

207
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,296
- I think that would be--
- Why are you undermining me?

208
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:09,736
How many bullets does this thing take?
Look, I'm paying attention.

209
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:13,242
Goddamn it! You're not paying attention
if you're messing around with the gun!

210
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:16,107
Now, quit-- Anthony,
keep the gun on the table.

211
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,612
Look, Dignan, relax.

212
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,308
I can't focus
unless the gun is on the table.

213
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,442
- I paid for it.
- Shut up, man!

214
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:24,713
I'm warning you now.
Be quiet, please.

215
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:28,245
- It's true. I paid for the gun.
- Say it one more time.

216
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,986
Say it again.
Repeat what you just said.

217
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,093
I paid for the gun.

218
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,464
He's out. You're out too.

219
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,508
- And I don't think I'm in, either.
- Calm down.

220
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:49,739
No gang!
You two just don't give a shit.

221
00:15:49,812 --> 00:15:53,145
When it comes right down to it,
you don't care.

222
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:56,083
How does an asshole like Bob
get such a great kitchen?

223
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:15,562
I apologize.
That was poor leadership.

224
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:18,835
I'm under a lot of pressure
right now, and...

225
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:22,872
I don't feel like the team
is gelling the way--

226
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:26,142
if I can even use that word, 'cause
I don't even know if we are a team.

227
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:29,116
Hey, we are a team.

228
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:35,285
Yeah, a team.

229
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:43,528
There. You see, the star is me.
Right there. I'll be in there.

230
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:47,126
The X is Anthony. Bob, you're
the zero out here in the car.

231
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,613
What are you putting that tape
on your nose for?

232
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,114
Exactly.

233
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:06,521
Let's get lucky.

234
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,327
Yo, you open the door.

235
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:17,059
- Okay, wait right here.
- Come on, let's go.

236
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:20,398
Don't panic.
Get him to open the door.

237
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,928
- Don't panic.
- I left my sweater inside.

238
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:27,533
I know. Do you have
a lost and found?

239
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,306
- Here he comes.
- A lost and found?

240
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,850
- I'm sorry. We're closed, sir.
- I left my sweater in--

241
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,218
What's that on your nose?

242
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:43,918
I cut it. I got a cut across the bridge.
Do you have a lost and found?

243
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:47,394
- Can you come back tomorrow?
- I can't. I gotta get it tonight.

244
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:51,263
Well, let me check with my manager.
Hold on one second. Just stand inside.

245
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,860
Hey, excuse me, sir.
We're closed.

246
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:57,997
- Oh. What about that guy?
- I left my sweater in here.

247
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:01,339
- He forgot his sweater.
- Oh, yeah? I left some money in there.

248
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:04,141
- Money? Where?
- In the cash register. Step back.

249
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:06,272
Stockers!
Where are the other stockers?

250
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:09,216
Who? Robbie? He might be in Literature.
That's his section.

251
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:12,448
Hey, is that the manager?
Who is that? Come here!

252
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:14,854
- I'm gonna go down this aisle.
- What's going on here?

253
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:17,256
- I'm sending you both back there.
- All right!

254
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:19,260
Come on, move!

255
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:28,434
Okay, sit down!
Get up against the wall!

256
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:31,530
What's in here? Where's the money?
Talk, stretch!

257
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,040
It's in the drawer.

258
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:36,168
Okay, there it is.
Come on, open up that drawer.

259
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,645
- No, it's not.
- The other one!

260
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,850
There's the money. Okay.

261
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,580
Put it in one of those bags.
Get one of those bags.

262
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:48,115
Let's move! Come on!
A bigger one, you idiot!

263
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,819
Don't call me an idiot,
you punk.

264
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,924
Do you have bigger bags
for atlases or dictionaries, sir?

265
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:06,100
- Robbie?
- Uh-huh.

266
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:09,076
Aren't you supposed to be in literature?

267
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:12,114
- It's all full up.
- They need you in the office right now.

268
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:15,048
Put the money in the little bags.
We'll just use a lot of them.

269
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:19,281
Quickly.
Just do your best.

270
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,653
Why do you wear
that tape on your nose?

271
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:25,150
Little bags, man.

272
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:30,021
Okay, everybody--
I want everybody to just sit tight.

273
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:33,068
Okay. Thank you so much.

274
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:39,032
Success! Full success!
We're heading back to Bob's.

275
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:43,841
We're gonna hit the road
and go on the lam! Go!

276
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:49,649
Okay now, before we divide the loot,
let me say one thing.

277
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:53,382
Bob gets the "Spirit Award"
on this caper.

278
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,856
And although his share
won't be as equal as ours--

279
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:58,257
- What? What are you--
- Come here, Bob.

280
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,592
Did you see the look he gave me?
Don't double-cross this guy.

281
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:05,828
Great work, both of you.
Clink, clink.

282
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:08,336
So, Dignan, what's next?

283
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,998
Do we meet the crew
after we go on the lam or what?

284
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:13,940
Everybody wants to know what's next.
May I enjoy this moment?

285
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,534
What crew?

286
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,643
Now is not a good time
to bring up the crew.

287
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:20,545
Goddamn it.

288
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:23,608
Ya son of a bitch!
You're gonna cut me out!

289
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:28,146
Wait a second, Bob. Nobody's
cutting anybody out of anything.

290
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,692
- Let me show you this.
- Whoa.

291
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,388
Bob should see this.

292
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:36,295
Bob, I got something.

293
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,493
- What's this supposed to be?
- That's the crew.

294
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:41,730
That's Mr. Henry.
He's a-- I know.

295
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:45,598
Anthony, that's the Lawn Wranglers...

296
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:49,111
the landscape company
that Dignan here used to work for.

297
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:51,112
What do you mean, landscaping?

298
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,743
I mean push the mower,
trim the hedge-- landscaping.

299
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:04,117
- Landscaping?
- Landscaping.

300
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:11,259
Yes, they're landscapers, okay?
Yes, they're landscapers.

301
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:13,666
But did it ever occur to you
that a landscaping crew...

302
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,966
is a perfect front
for an operation?

303
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,632
Look at this.
You've seen this picture.

304
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,734
That is Mr. Henry, and aside
from owning the Lawn Wranglers...

305
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:23,745
he is a very talented thief.

306
00:21:23,813 --> 00:21:27,044
Then why aren't you over there
right now?

307
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:29,380
Because we're fugitives.

308
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:34,148
And also because he fired me.

309
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:41,422
Best job I ever had--

310
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:44,625
working my way up, meeting people...

311
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,294
listening to stories.

312
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,931
One day he walks over and says,
"Dignan, you're out, " just like that.

313
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:54,842
By the way, man, he was right.

314
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,778
Just because it's a front doesn't mean
somebody doesn't have to do landscaping.

315
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:03,575
But those days are over now.

316
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:06,053
Just a matter of time
before I pick up the phone and say...

317
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:09,489
"Mr. H. , we are coming home."

318
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:13,494
So don't worry about your future, man,
because I am thinking.

319
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,702
If you don't mind, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention...

320
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,764
to Bob about me getting fired.

321
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:27,433
I won't.

322
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:41,388
On the run from Johnny Law.

323
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:43,448
It ain't no trip to Cleveland.

324
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:13,878
I love it!

325
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:16,515
And another one for me!

326
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:20,019
Bobby, one for you!

327
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:22,223
Anthony, fire away!

328
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:25,461
Somebody hand me one! I'm gonna
throw it out the window! Cherry bomb!

329
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:29,164
Did you hear that?

330
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:32,537
Dignan, I don't expect you
to be as depressed as I am...

331
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,906
but I don't think--
Watch the road, Bob.

332
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:38,743
But I don't think that
your happiness is quite appropriate.

333
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:42,511
I mean, your 75-year plan
does not seem to be working, you know?

334
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:46,681
The only thing I've learned so far
is that crime does not pay.

335
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:51,126
Gee, man, that's not the greatest
attitude in the world to have.

336
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:53,525
I don't think we get anywhere
by complaining, guys.

337
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:55,996
Okay. You're right.

338
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:57,999
There we go.

339
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:01,093
Perfect little place to lie low.

340
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,503
We'll get in touch with Mr. Henry.
I'll get the best room in the house.

341
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,006
Crime does pay.

342
00:25:29,225 --> 00:25:33,423
I can't get my hair cut.
That's just no possible, all right?

343
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:37,056
You're gonna have to dye it red, man,
'cause we need to hide our identities.

344
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:40,499
No, I'm sorry.
I can't do that either.

345
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:45,029
Even if it's the difference between
some trooper throwing us in jail or not?

346
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,540
I guess so.

347
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:49,442
Then you, my dear friend,
are a damn fool.

348
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:52,969
Let's go, Bob.
Come on. Bob, let's go!

349
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:54,982
- See you.
- See you later, Bob.

350
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,517
A damn fool!

351
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:08,657
- Excuse me.
- No, it's okay. Come on in.

352
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,934
Oh, excuse me.

353
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:20,508
Gee, it's great how you're able
to bring a room to life like this...

354
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:22,510
with just a little touch.

355
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:34,489
Geez, it's--
It's nice out today, isn't it?

356
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:37,320
Boy, you get a nice breeze
with that door open like this.

357
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,327
It was kind of stuffy in here.

358
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:42,262
Do you do all of these rooms
yourself? All of these--

359
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:46,834
I'm Anthony. Anthony.

360
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:53,168
What's your name?

361
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:56,734
- Inez.
- Inez. That's-- Wow.

362
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,979
Oh. Sorry.

363
00:27:08,557 --> 00:27:11,390
Sorry this is such a mess here.

364
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,951
Here, let me give you
a hand with this.

365
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,736
I think I might've seen you
earlier when I was swimming.

366
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:32,303
Did you happen to see me there?
By the pool?

367
00:27:33,682 --> 00:27:36,242
Yeah, that was me.

368
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:37,751
Yep.

369
00:27:40,856 --> 00:27:43,290
You speak English?

370
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,792
Spanish?

371
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:51,126
You have really good posture, you know?
You stand up very straight.

372
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:54,867
You know, people think
that 'cause they're in a hotel...

373
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:57,531
that they can really
just kind of act like slobs.

374
00:27:57,606 --> 00:28:00,370
It's bad manners,
if you ask me.

375
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:03,070
But then, if I were guilty
of it, yeah.

376
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:05,477
Which part of Mexico are you from?

377
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:07,481
- Paraguay.
- Paraguay.

378
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:09,983
Boy, okay.
That's kind of over--

379
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:11,986
- Excuse me.
- Under Guatemala, I think.

380
00:28:12,054 --> 00:28:13,988
Sorry, Inez.

381
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:19,022
These towels are still warm.

382
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:22,086
I guess that's
from the dryer. See?

383
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:25,931
Housekeeping.

384
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,799
- Sorry.
- No. We're just checking out.

385
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:49,117
- 0 and 2.
- Son of a bitch!

386
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,553
That's a good haircut there.
Parted on the side.

387
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:55,654
- Thank you.
- That's what my friend needs to get.

388
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,665
Bob, get one like this.

389
00:28:57,733 --> 00:29:00,429
- They're one out away from a win.
- Here, you go first.

390
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:02,561
May I speak to you
for a moment, please?

391
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:05,106
It's about my marijuana crop.
I don't want everyone to hear this.

392
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:08,166
- I don't want to lose my place in line.
- My brother is in jail.

393
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:12,839
What? Wait a second.
Your brother's-- Why?

394
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:15,713
- The weed.
- What weed?

395
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:18,651
The weed from my back--
from my back yard.

396
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:28,390
They got him by the balls.
What's the official charge?

397
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:30,523
They say he's a drug dealer.

398
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,001
That's so unfair.
They say he's a drug dealer?

399
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,368
You and I both know
he's not a drug dealer.

400
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,566
Right?

401
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:41,905
- He's not a drug dealer.
- I know, Dignan. I know.

402
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:46,539
Well? Well, Bob, what about
hiding our identities?

403
00:29:48,117 --> 00:29:51,609
I'm sorry, guys. We're gonna
have to take a rain check.

404
00:29:56,492 --> 00:30:00,519
God, this is great,
sitting here in the laundry room...

405
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:05,260
you working on your vocabulary
and we're sharing these tamales.

406
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,800
It's-- It's just, how unexpected.

407
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,805
What is that, Inez?

408
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:18,574
Does that open?

409
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:26,944
Wow, you were just a little girl
when this was taken.

410
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:29,650
A little girl in Paraguay.

411
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:36,021
May I keep this?
May I have it?

412
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,729
She's my sister.

413
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,633
Really?

414
00:30:44,306 --> 00:30:46,467
She looks just like you.

415
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:51,170
Can I keep it anyway?

416
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:11,164
- I'm sorry. We're in the wrong room.
- No, man, this is--

417
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,667
No. Okay, I guess
there's been a mistake made.

418
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:18,365
212? Do you speak English?
We have a friend.

419
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:26,079
What the--

420
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:30,478
Thought you guys
went to get your hair cut.

421
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:32,452
No, we didn't.

422
00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:35,486
Well, gang,
this is my friend Dig--

423
00:31:35,557 --> 00:31:39,186
My name's Jerry, and this is Cornelius.
Anthony, what's going on?

424
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:42,424
I'm having a party in here.
I made some banana daiquiris.

425
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:45,022
- Do you want one?
- Yeah, I guess I'll have one.

426
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,830
Come on in here, man.

427
00:31:47,903 --> 00:31:51,168
This is Inez,
and that's Rocky right there.

428
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,504
Come on, Bob. Shut the door.
Get in here, man.

429
00:31:53,575 --> 00:31:57,011
Anybody else want anything?
Soda for Rocky.

430
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:00,242
- Come on, Bob, let me get you one.
- Anthony, I've got to talk to you!

431
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:02,715
Look, I'm sorry.
This seems like a nice soiree...

432
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:04,479
but I've got a family situation.

433
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:06,646
I don't care what you think.

434
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:14,158
Dignan does not want to deal with it.
Please come outside for a minute!

435
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:17,596
Bob, I'm just saying we gotta
analyze the situation, okay?

436
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,134
First of all,
how long are they gonna hold him?

437
00:32:20,202 --> 00:32:24,298
I don't know. All I know is that Phil
says they got him, that he's in jail.

438
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:28,537
Okay, I've made a suggestion
that he needs to hire an attorney.

439
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,601
You are pushing your luck, man.

440
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,171
- Hey, Dignan, he does have a point.
- I'm the leader.

441
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:37,218
- You think I should abandon my brother?
- Yeah.

442
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:41,086
I'm saying let's keep it--
Let's keep it very simple, okay?

443
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:45,957
We'll make some calls,
figure out what's going on...

444
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:49,225
and if he's not out in 48 hours,
then we'll go back, okay?

445
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:54,631
- What?
- Is that okay?

446
00:32:57,072 --> 00:33:00,337
And I wasn't trying to antagonize you
by saying that stuff.

447
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:02,400
It's just you were gonna
fly off half-cocked.

448
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:06,379
- Don't tell me what I was gonna do.
- It's a team decision.

449
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:24,860
What? What did you--
What does that mean?

450
00:33:31,673 --> 00:33:34,005
l-- I don't know
what to say.

451
00:33:34,076 --> 00:33:36,943
- What I'm talking?
- No.

452
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:46,346
Your skin feels like silk.

453
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:49,690
Like silk?

454
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,062
- What silk?
- Your skin, it feels so soft and silky.

455
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:59,760
- It's soft.
- Silk?

456
00:33:59,835 --> 00:34:02,599
Sandpaper. Silk.

457
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:07,940
- Silk. A new word.
- It's very soft.

458
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:10,136
I don't know it in Spanish.

459
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,746
Can I kiss you?

460
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:32,556
Marco! Marco!

461
00:34:35,303 --> 00:34:38,898
No lifeguard on duty.
Swim at your own risk.

462
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:45,510
Okay, we'll-- We'll be
very careful, Jerry. Thank you.

463
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,515
You guys mind if I take a dip?
Hey, I'm kidding.

464
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,847
I'm not that insensitive.

465
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,980
Besides, I didn't bring my trunks,
anyway. How's the water down there?

466
00:34:55,056 --> 00:34:58,958
I'm gonna give you something, okay?
I want you to hold onto this.

467
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:04,087
Well, thank you for listening
to our old war stories.

468
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,828
I hope they didn't bore you
too terribly.

469
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,799
- Well, anyway, good evening.
- Bye, Jerry.

470
00:35:15,877 --> 00:35:18,311
Anyways, the watch, okay?

471
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,075
It has an alarm on it...

472
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:23,743
and will go off and make a sound
when we're supposed to meet.

473
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:27,550
You do that by this little button.
You can just press that. See?

474
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:32,526
It's pretty simple.

475
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:41,266
- I have to go.
- I'm very glad I met you, Inez.

476
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,531
Me too. I have to go.

477
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:01,513
Son of a bitch!

478
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:08,562
Bob's gone!
He stole his car!

479
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,326
That little coward!
That son of a bitch!

480
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:14,966
Son of a bitch, man.

481
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,136
He flew the coop
while we were sleepin'.

482
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:25,375
- He has no character, man.
- Maybe he went up to the store.

483
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:28,177
No, man, he took his stuff.
He's long gone.

484
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,481
Hi, housekeeping?
Could I speak to Inez, please?

485
00:36:31,553 --> 00:36:34,579
I thought she gets in at 9:00.

486
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:37,386
Oh, it-- Okay. See,
I don't have my watch on.

487
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,290
She has it.

488
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:42,125
Tell me something.
What's it like working with her?

489
00:36:42,197 --> 00:36:45,598
I bet she's really great at--
Okay. Bye.

490
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:50,001
We'll get him. We'll get him, man.
Don't worry about that.

491
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:53,837
And we'll blow up his car
or do something, I guarantee you that.

492
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:57,538
What makes me furious is thinking
about the look on Bob's fat face...

493
00:36:57,612 --> 00:37:01,343
when he drives away today thinking
that he's pulled one over on us.

494
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:03,884
- I'll tell you another thing--
- Dignan, please.

495
00:37:03,952 --> 00:37:08,218
If our paths cross again, you're gonna
see a side of me you haven't seen yet--

496
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,817
a sick, sadistic side--
because I'm furious at Bob.

497
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:15,294
- Come on, Dignan!
- Come on what?

498
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:19,197
Bob didn't steal the car.
You know, he told me he was leaving.

499
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:22,259
He went back to help his brother.

500
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,336
Dignan, look. I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about Bob leaving.

501
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:33,609
You had just as much right
to know as I did. I'm sorry.

502
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:36,549
Thank you.
That's all I needed.

503
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:39,712
I mean, who's to say that you need Bob
to have an adventure?

504
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:42,552
Where's that rule written?
There's nothing that says that.

505
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:44,558
What are you working on?

506
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:47,094
Just a sketch. It's--

507
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:50,758
It's, you know,
just a little horse...

508
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:56,160
with little sparks comin' off,
kind of like stardust.

509
00:37:56,237 --> 00:37:58,398
Nothin'.

510
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:01,403
Sorry. It's just--

511
00:38:01,476 --> 00:38:04,639
Don't apologize to me.
Don't do that to me.

512
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:08,547
Don't treat me like the jealous friend,
because that's not what this is about.

513
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:11,586
I'm as excited for you
as anybody is.

514
00:38:11,653 --> 00:38:14,349
Really? Then I gotta go.

515
00:38:14,422 --> 00:38:16,447
I'll see you later, Dignan.
See you back at the room.

516
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:42,638
It's so weird,
the way this happened.

517
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:45,111
It's so good to be with you.

518
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:12,529
Why don't you come over to this bar
we're going to, Dignan?

519
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:15,508
- Where?
- It's in the town.

520
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:17,545
No, I don't want to go.

521
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:22,442
Why don't you just come with us?

522
00:40:29,023 --> 00:40:32,459
Why don't you just
come over there with us?

523
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,119
All right.

524
00:40:42,537 --> 00:40:43,970
Sparkler.

525
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:46,199
I certainly can't feel
any worse than I do.

526
00:40:46,274 --> 00:40:48,208
Don't worry.
All he needs is one drink.

527
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:53,146
Hello, my friend.

528
00:40:56,651 --> 00:41:01,088
- You're in the army, yes?
- No. I just have short hair.

529
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:05,021
Amigo, let's play pool!

530
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:29,606
Boy, that guy was
a real chatterbox, wasn't he?

531
00:41:29,684 --> 00:41:33,415
I didn't think he was ever gonna
stop with the story. Jesus!

532
00:41:33,488 --> 00:41:36,116
That's what I call
a language barrier.

533
00:41:36,191 --> 00:41:39,752
- I need to take it easy.
- Amigo, you just cheated!

534
00:41:39,828 --> 00:41:42,126
Okay! I'm calling my gang!

535
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:46,759
It's just a little frustrating
when you guys talk so easily.

536
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:51,431
God, you know, I can't believe the guy
just decided to jump you like that.

537
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:56,744
- Can you pass me those french fries?
- Yeah.

538
00:41:58,012 --> 00:42:02,278
Dignan, you know I was right out
in front of the place with Inez.

539
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,944
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not relive it.

540
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:08,679
Don't really feel
much like talking about it.

541
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:13,816
In fact, the only thing I feel like
is getting the fuck out of this town.

542
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:17,831
Yeah. We need a car, I think.

543
00:42:17,899 --> 00:42:19,958
I have an idea for that.

544
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:23,526
Inez has a master key
to all the rooms, doesn't she?

545
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:27,138
Doesn't she?

546
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,142
I don't think we can do that.

547
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,269
I know we can.
It's real simple.

548
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:34,076
We go into another room,
take some car keys--

549
00:42:34,148 --> 00:42:37,140
It's not even
a possibility, okay?

550
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:46,718
Then we're gonna
have to hot-wire a car...

551
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:49,456
and this idea
I don't back down from.

552
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,966
- This idea--
- Inez, let's go outside.

553
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:54,968
- Jerry's not--
- How are you, Jerry?

554
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:59,497
I feel great, Inez.

555
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:03,135
He's under the weather
a little bit.

556
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:06,408
- So, l--
- Bye.

557
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:09,245
I kind of gotta take care of him
for a few minutes.

558
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:17,924
I had a really great time.

559
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:45,816
Inez, I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but I think I've got it.

560
00:43:47,288 --> 00:43:51,247
I've gotta talk to you, Inez.
I got a lot I need to tell you.

561
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:54,853
Thirty seconds ago, I was lost,
just in a total fog...

562
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:57,693
and then it hit me
like a bolt of lightning.

563
00:43:57,765 --> 00:44:01,895
Perfect clarity. Don't slow me down.
I gotta get this out while it's fresh.

564
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,564
Um, this could get
a little tough to communicate.

565
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,573
Where's the kid?
Where's Rocky?

566
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:08,404
- Hey, Rocky.
- Yeah?

567
00:44:08,476 --> 00:44:10,808
- Can you help me out?
- What do you need?

568
00:44:10,878 --> 00:44:13,210
I just need you
to translate some stuff.

569
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:15,806
I can't. I'm busy.
I got too much work.

570
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:18,511
It'll take two seconds.
Just give me three minutes.

571
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:22,181
Come on. Please. I'll help you
finish the dishes later.

572
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,927
Okay, this is what I want to say.
This is how I see it.

573
00:44:28,696 --> 00:44:33,463
Beautiful, intelligent girl
from Paraguay...

574
00:44:35,136 --> 00:44:38,936
by chance happens to be workin'
at a motel in the middle of nowhere.

575
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:42,465
Lost and confused.
Totally lost.

576
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:44,875
Incredibly unhappy person...

577
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:48,279
accidentally wanders in
off the highway...

578
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:53,013
and they meet
and they fall in love...

579
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:54,816
and it's perfect.

580
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:57,050
I mean, it is perfect.

581
00:44:58,226 --> 00:44:59,989
And I can only hope...

582
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:05,192
that she feels a tenth
of the way that I feel.

583
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:11,537
I mean, Inez, when we had sex
this afternoon, it was--

584
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:14,268
It was fun, you know?

585
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,309
So-- Come on, Rocky.

586
00:45:23,885 --> 00:45:26,718
Okay, so to make
a long story short...

587
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:32,286
when we leave here tomorrow,
I want you to come with us.

588
00:45:35,063 --> 00:45:36,724
And I want us, no matter what--

589
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:39,296
Where are you going?

590
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:43,698
- What?
- Where are you going?

591
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:46,001
Where are we going?

592
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:51,701
What do you want me to say?
You want me to live with you and Jerry?

593
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:53,940
- I can't go.
- Why not?

594
00:45:54,015 --> 00:45:56,245
Why?

595
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:01,011
- I just told you why not.
- That's no reason, Inez.

596
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:03,956
I'm trying to explain to you
why I want you to come with us.

597
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:14,563
Look. Wait, wait.

598
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:17,661
We'll stay here, all right?
I don't understand it, but...

599
00:46:17,738 --> 00:46:21,504
I'm just gonna follow
my instincts on this one.

600
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:31,943
You're like paper.
You know, you're trash.

601
00:46:33,788 --> 00:46:35,221
Like trash?

602
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,587
You know, you're
like paper flying by.

603
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:41,093
It doesn't sound
that bad in Spanish.

604
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:56,409
Well, what, Rocky?

605
00:46:57,545 --> 00:47:00,776
She-- She doesn't
want you to stay.

606
00:47:03,317 --> 00:47:04,750
She doesn't?

607
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:07,720
You have to understand.
She's an organized person.

608
00:47:07,788 --> 00:47:12,054
- She can't just leave.
- She didn't say that, did she, Rocky?

609
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:14,856
No, but I'm just telling you,
she's a serious person.

610
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:17,227
Please, just do the--

611
00:47:32,013 --> 00:47:33,605
Excuse me.

612
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:39,385
Mi amigo Anthony asked me
to give you this envelope.

613
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:42,251
There you go. We certainly
enjoyed our stay here.

614
00:47:42,323 --> 00:47:45,952
We'd recommend this motel
to any of our friends that might--

615
00:47:47,528 --> 00:47:49,462
Take care of Anthony.

616
00:47:57,738 --> 00:48:01,469
- Is okay?
- Yeah, I feel a lot better.

617
00:48:07,915 --> 00:48:09,849
So long.

618
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:28,168
Jerry!

619
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:34,972
- Tell Anthony I love him.
- Do what?

620
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,977
Tell Anthony I love him.

621
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:45,810
All right, man. Okay.

622
00:50:01,896 --> 00:50:05,696
Shit, man.
What a lemon!

623
00:50:05,766 --> 00:50:08,462
I don't know, man.
One minute it's running like a top...

624
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:11,733
and the next minute it's broken down
on the side of the road.

625
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:15,469
I can't fix a car like this.
I don't have the tools to do it, man!

626
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:19,104
Even if I did, I can't promise you
I'd know how to fix a car like that!

627
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,546
You see the house over here?

628
00:50:21,615 --> 00:50:24,049
Let's walk over to it.
We'll use the phone.

629
00:50:24,118 --> 00:50:25,710
We need to go home, okay?

630
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:28,482
Whoa, no.
Let's go to plan B.

631
00:50:28,556 --> 00:50:30,581
We'll hitchhike to the next town--
Look, we hitchhike--

632
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:33,593
Look, it's over, okay?
We're broke.

633
00:50:33,661 --> 00:50:35,424
We're gonna go home.

634
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:37,430
First of all, what is broke to you?

635
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:41,059
You're so spoiled. Having only
a few hundred dollars is not broke.

636
00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:43,330
We're okay.
This is a setback. We hitchhike--

637
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:46,339
What is this?

638
00:50:48,576 --> 00:50:50,271
All right. $16.

639
00:50:50,344 --> 00:50:52,608
So, where's the rest of the money?

640
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,807
You gave it to Inez.

641
00:50:56,484 --> 00:50:58,714
No, I never gave Inez anything.

642
00:51:00,588 --> 00:51:02,749
In the envelope.

643
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:35,445
Pointless act! You don't give
a $500 tip to the housekeeper!

644
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:38,515
That's inappropriate!
That's inexcusable!

645
00:51:38,592 --> 00:51:41,652
That, I don't forgive!
What were you thinking?

646
00:51:43,664 --> 00:51:45,689
- Don't call her the housekeeper.
- That's what she is.

647
00:51:45,766 --> 00:51:48,257
Don't threaten me. That's what she is.
She is a housekeeper.

648
00:51:48,335 --> 00:51:50,633
- People are housekeepers.
- You better watch it.

649
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:53,138
You don't know what you're talking about
right now.

650
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:56,005
Her name's Inez.

651
00:51:56,076 --> 00:51:58,670
And my name's Dignan, man.
So what?

652
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:03,278
She didn't love you, man.

653
00:52:05,786 --> 00:52:07,219
Now where are you going?

654
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:23,434
Come on. Let's go.

655
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:25,699
Why did you do it, man?

656
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:30,672
I don't really think you know
what I was going through back there--

657
00:52:30,744 --> 00:52:33,474
Please don't lay that on me now, man...

658
00:52:33,547 --> 00:52:36,175
because I'm not interested
in hearing any of that.

659
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:41,620
Did it ever occur to you that I might
enjoy a great stay...

660
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:44,351
at some mental hospital
out in the middle of nowhere...

661
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:48,452
going running at night, getting a tan
with a bunch of beautiful girls?

662
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:50,690
Did you ever think about that?

663
00:52:50,764 --> 00:52:55,224
What do you think Dignan was doing
that whole time you were out there?

664
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:59,762
I told you Dignan got fired--
out on his ass.

665
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,933
But you never thought about that,
did you?

666
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:07,948
In the end it's easier to think about
yourself than to think about Dignan.

667
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,275
Dignan, come on.

668
00:53:14,288 --> 00:53:18,349
I thought I was supposed to be the one
that was a little crazy, you know?

669
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:24,090
Dignan, come on.

670
00:54:03,304 --> 00:54:03,337
"Dear Grace, I enjoyed your letter.

671
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:05,999
"Dear Grace, I enjoyed your letter.

672
00:54:06,073 --> 00:54:08,667
I agree Camp Douglas isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

673
00:54:08,742 --> 00:54:10,334
It never was.

674
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:13,005
But if you're feeling lonely
or homesick even...

675
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,039
I recommend that, one, you call me.
I'm staying at Bob Mapplethorpe's...

676
00:54:17,117 --> 00:54:19,677
and, two,
that you keep extremely busy.

677
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:22,916
- It's working for me.
- Come here, Hector.

678
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,356
I've got a whole, new program.

679
00:54:25,426 --> 00:54:29,021
Bob and I get up at 5:30 every morning
to run our paper route.

680
00:54:29,096 --> 00:54:30,893
I've got three jobs.

681
00:54:30,965 --> 00:54:35,334
The money isn't much, and Bob
isn't suited for this kind of work.

682
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,097
But we keep each other company...

683
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:41,039
and we both feel much better about
ourselves now that we're working hard.

684
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:45,135
- Glad you enjoyed it. You all come back.
- Thanks, Mr. Fine.

685
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:49,148
Jack, I've been working.
I made $75 in tips last night.

686
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:52,583
Bob's brother, Future Man, has
accumulated some extensive legal debts.

687
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:55,087
But we're gradually helping him
to pay those off.

688
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:57,123
Can I at least have three bucks for gas?

689
00:54:58,555 --> 00:54:59,523
No, you can't.

690
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:04,560
I'm also coaching a Little League
soccer team called the Hurricanes.

691
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:06,859
They're mostly beginners,
but they've got a lot of spirit...

692
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:09,198
and they don't let defeat get them down.

693
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,295
They remind me of Dignan in that way.

694
00:55:11,372 --> 00:55:15,832
Say what you will about him,
he's no cynic and he's no quitter.

695
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,344
I'm usually so exhausted now
at the end of the day...

696
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:20,904
so that I don't have time
to think about blown opportunities...

697
00:55:20,982 --> 00:55:22,916
or wasted time.

698
00:55:22,984 --> 00:55:25,680
I do have one bit of advice
for you though, Grace.

699
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:28,950
Take the time in school
to learn a foreign language.

700
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:33,084
I myself never did,
and I feel I paid a price for it.

701
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:36,592
Well, so long, Grace.

702
00:55:36,664 --> 00:55:39,758
I miss you very much.
Don't forget to write me back.

703
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:41,267
Anthony."

704
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,501
Okay, there he goes.

705
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,642
It's Dignan. Wait up!

706
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,779
Where are you going?

707
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,481
I'm just walking Hector.

708
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:02,717
How long you been back?

709
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,555
A while.

710
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:08,119
So how's it goin'?

711
00:56:08,197 --> 00:56:10,722
It's goin' pretty good.

712
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,435
I wish that some of the stuff
that was said...

713
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:23,377
hadn't been said out there by me...

714
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,141
and--

715
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:27,546
I'm sorry...

716
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,050
about--

717
00:56:31,854 --> 00:56:34,186
Do you wanna shake hands?

718
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,164
What's this you got on, man?

719
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:47,702
It's a jumpsuit.

720
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:50,034
You like it?
I ordered a dozen of them.

721
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,506
Anthony, I'd like to introduce you
to Applejack.

722
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,203
- Applejack, this is Anthony.
- Anthony Adams.

723
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,580
Mr. Henry! It's Dignan!

724
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,351
Got some visitors.

725
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:11,118
- What time did he say he'd be here?
- Right now.

726
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:17,295
Did you guys feel that?
I just felt something--

727
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,267
Hey! Jesus Christ!

728
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,100
How's the weather down there?

729
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,234
- Come on in.
- Well, it's locked.

730
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,744
- No, no. Come on, son.
- Okay.

731
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:32,246
I just tried it,
but I'll try it again.

732
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,077
Yes, it is!

733
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,718
He poured more water on me.

734
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:47,025
- Dignan, good to see you.
- Hi, Mr. Henry.

735
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,893
Applejack, good to--

736
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,899
And who are you?

737
00:57:53,035 --> 00:57:55,526
- That's Anthony--
- This is no good, bringing him here.

738
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,472
What the shit, man?
What are you thinking?

739
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,236
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

740
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,607
How are you?

741
00:58:05,214 --> 00:58:08,115
This is my business manager, Rowboat.

742
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,982
Get you a little wet, did l, son?
Come on in, boys.

743
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:12,987
There you go.

744
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:18,289
That's it.
Give it a little topspin.

745
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:20,158
A little more!

746
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:22,964
Good. He listens.

747
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,327
- This kid in?
- I don't know. Are you in?

748
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:31,707
- You don't understand.
- Let me tell you about this job.

749
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:33,504
- You don't understand.
- Let me tell you about this job.

750
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,511
I got this program
and I'm trying to stick to it, okay?

751
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,513
Just hear me out.

752
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:44,149
It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Here are a few of the key ingredients:

753
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,747
dynamite, pole vaulting,
laughing gas, choppers--

754
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:51,521
Can you see how incredible
this is going to be? Come on!

755
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,528
I can't do it.

756
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,861
I know, but if he doesn't have
the enthusiasm, then who needs him?

757
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,768
Oh, you said a mouthful.

758
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,170
If you want, I could speak to him.

759
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,470
Would you, Mr. Henry?
That'd be great.

760
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:09,511
- Sugar cone?
- You bet.

761
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,672
- Do you want anything, Anthony?
- No, thanks.

762
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,952
Listen.

763
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:20,182
You know...

764
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,588
you're breaking his heart,
you know that, don't you?

765
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,991
What do you mean?

766
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,828
Kid that worked
on one of my garden crews--

767
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,267
I mean, nice fella,
but he didn't perform.

768
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,805
So I had to fire him.

769
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,738
Then six months later...

770
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:43,040
I get a call from a gas station...

771
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,137
about 200 miles
outside of Victoria there.

772
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:48,012
I said, "What the hell
are you doing out there?"

773
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,676
But there's something in his voice.

774
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,084
You know what I'm saying?

775
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:55,419
I felt for him.
I mean, poor guy.

776
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,119
Here he is, he thought he had a team.

777
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,992
Turns out to be a man alone.

778
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:04,794
And that's tough, man.
Real tough.

779
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,698
Here you go.

780
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:27,880
- Had any time to think?
- Yeah, I've done a lot of thinking.

781
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,073
We're still holding
your position open for you.

782
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,337
Yeah, I wish you wouldn't do that.

783
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,574
- Come on. Go for a ride.
- It's too small for the both of us.

784
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,877
No it isn't. Jump on.
I'll give you a pump.

785
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,351
- Where'd you get this?
- I got it from a fr--

786
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,118
What are you wearing?

787
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:08,026
It's a jumpsuit.

788
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:11,328
- Clay, look at this guy.
- He looks like a rodeo clown.

789
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,766
He looks like a little banana.
Where are you from anyway, man?

790
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,997
I'm from around here.

791
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,562
- He used to mow our lawn.
- No shit?

792
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,667
He was great-- clipping the hedges,
sweeping up, mowing the lawn.

793
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,209
What was the name
of your little lawn mowing company?

794
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,874
The Lawn Wranglers.

795
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,878
Let's go.

796
01:01:34,156 --> 01:01:36,215
Keep up the mowing, kemo sabe.

797
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:44,057
It was landscaping, not just mowing.

798
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,725
Man, don't listen to that guy.

799
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:47,826
I don't know.
Sometimes l--

800
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,996
I'm not always as confident as I look.

801
01:01:50,072 --> 01:01:52,438
- Did you see what he had on?
- Yeah.

802
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:54,567
It was pretty cool.

803
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,840
All right.

804
01:01:58,914 --> 01:02:00,848
Wait a second.

805
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,451
What?

806
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:16,226
Goddamn it. I'm in.

807
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:20,095
- What?
- I'm in.

808
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,160
I knew you'd be back.

809
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,172
Three conditions.

810
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,175
One: you mastermind the plan.

811
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:32,275
Two: Bob's on the team.

812
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,407
Let's hear the third one.

813
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:41,715
You gotta get me one of these jumpsuits.

814
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,224
- You like these?
- Yeah!

815
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,760
Done. Deal. All right.

816
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,991
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, I know I am.

817
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,693
All right. I'll see you later on.

818
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:58,137
- Need any help?
- No, I think I got it.

819
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,444
Ha-ha! Got the eye.

820
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,788
Got the eye again.

821
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:21,755
Well, move back a little bit!

822
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,163
Hi, guys.
Welcome back.

823
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:27,634
- He's back, Mr. Henry.
- Where's Bob? The rich kid?

824
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,596
- Hey, what do you say?
- How's it goin'?

825
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,733
Dignan! What do you say?
Come on in.

826
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:36,039
- Oh, nothing much.
- What are you guys drinking?

827
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:39,206
- Water for me, please.
- I'll have a Tom Collins, please.

828
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:40,805
Tom Collins. Okay.

829
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:43,977
I want you to know it was really too bad
about what happened out there.

830
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,351
- I'm glad to see you.
- Yeah, it was unfortunate.

831
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,617
- Let's not even talk about it.
- It was stupid.

832
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,591
It was real stupid.
It was extremely stupid.

833
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:54,026
I want you to know
I don't expect an apology.

834
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,792
Can you believe this guy?
"I don't expect an apology."

835
01:03:56,866 --> 01:04:00,461
- Let's not get into this.
- Of course you don't wanna get into it.

836
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,697
You would have let my brother
rot in fucking jail!

837
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,866
- You said 48 hours!
- I never agreed to that.

838
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:08,739
- That's a lie!
- Bullshit!

839
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:11,371
- Backyard! Right now! Let's go!
- Just wait here.

840
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:16,544
- Come on, Bob.
- Backyard? This is my house, asshole!

841
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,280
- Get out here!
- Wait a second!

842
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,517
I know you're feeling angry
and I think the thing to do is--

843
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,558
- We're all here. Let's talk.
- Wait a second!

844
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,720
Bob is a big boy.
Now, we are in the real world.

845
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:30,789
We don't settle problems with hugs. We
settle them with bare-knuckle tactics.

846
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:34,063
Let's talk about that.

847
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,297
- Fine!
- Bob, stay there!

848
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,773
- In my own house?
- Stop it!

849
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,639
Just stop!

850
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:47,148
- You got me with a left hook.
- Okay, no more fighting.

851
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,979
Bob, come here.

852
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,349
I'm gonna hug him.

853
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,917
What are we doing out here?
What happened?

854
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:57,390
Man!

855
01:04:57,459 --> 01:05:00,758
- You went crazy.
- I know. I just-- I don't know.

856
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,957
- Come here.
- I was looking forward to seeing you.

857
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,900
Bob, we'd like to have you on the team,
if you'll have us.

858
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:10,496
Roberto, let me get something straight.

859
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,565
- You don't play any tennis.
- No.

860
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:17,669
- And you don't play any golf.
- No.

861
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:20,237
So why do you belong to a country club?

862
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,614
You got me.

863
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,483
You're a piece of work.

864
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:28,421
- The food is very good.
- Well, yeah. You just sign.

865
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:31,050
My work is the finger work.

866
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:33,060
Usually my work is--

867
01:05:34,129 --> 01:05:37,223
Little sound and good touch.

868
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:39,358
- How you doin', Bob?
- Hey, Jackson.

869
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,995
When will your folks
be back in town?

870
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,733
That's hard to say.
Last I heard they were in Singapore.

871
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:48,641
Your brother was up here the other day.
He said you ran away from home.

872
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,440
- What?
- You ran away from home.

873
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:52,309
Oh, shit.

874
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:57,843
- I'll see you.
- Hi, guys. Bob, fancy seeing you here.

875
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,785
The rest of the gang?

876
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,618
- Hi, John Mapplethorpe.
- Kumar.

877
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:03,282
Nice to meet you.

878
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,454
Applejack, nice to meet you.

879
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:10,794
- John, great pleasure to meet you.
- And your name is?

880
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,630
Jackson said you told him
I ran away from home.

881
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:15,795
I might have mentioned it.

882
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:18,339
I'm 26 years old.
I didn't run away from home.

883
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:21,467
Oh, that's right.
You're on that top secret mission.

884
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:24,444
I'm sorry. I forgot I wasn't
supposed to say anything.

885
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:29,084
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
run around telling lies about me.

886
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,415
I'm sorry. I apologize.

887
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,979
I know you have a reputation to uphold.

888
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:37,719
It won't happen again.

889
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,455
- Jonathan.
- Yeah?

890
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,130
You know, Jonathan...

891
01:06:46,101 --> 01:06:49,264
the world needs dreamers.

892
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,329
- Excuse me?
- No, I don't think so.

893
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,144
You know, one day I believe
that you're gonna wake up...

894
01:06:56,211 --> 01:06:58,475
and realize you no longer
have a brother...

895
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,448
and you no longer have any friends,
and on that day...

896
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:05,317
I'm gonna be standing front and center
just laughing my fuckin' head off.

897
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:16,196
God!

898
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,691
I'm just messin' around with my brother.

899
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:21,463
- Are we okay here?
- Okay.

900
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,241
I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob...

901
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,648
but your brother's a cocksucker.

902
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,209
- I know.
- Did I offend you?

903
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,653
- That didn't offend me.
- Good.

904
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,666
Well, welcome
I've got a beautiful house

905
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:01,335
Hispanic male, nonsmoker,
enters white van, southwest door.

906
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,469
- Mark that down.
- I did.

907
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:08,175
There you go.
Drive away, just like you always do.

908
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:15,284
We got it, man. We know it backwards,
and we know it forewords...

909
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,951
because we've done the legwork,
and we've done the research.

910
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,188
And now it pays off tomorrow.

911
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,992
- Just gotta follow through.
- What are you working on?

912
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,999
Let me show you this.

913
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,735
Wow, that's one of your little drawings.

914
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:32,137
There he goes-- pole vaults over the
thing. There he goes, and there he is.

915
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:35,574
I love the drawings. I love it.
You're creative.

916
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,306
Tell me something.

917
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,315
What do you think of Inez?

918
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,783
- As a person?
- Yeah, as a girl.

919
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,888
I liked her.

920
01:08:47,956 --> 01:08:50,789
I thought she was a good person.
She was friendly.

921
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:54,454
She was attractive. I didn't get
to know her as well as you did.

922
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,930
That's the only reason
I even bother to hesitate.

923
01:08:56,999 --> 01:09:00,799
That kid Rocky struck me
as kind of a weirdo.

924
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:02,996
What? Rocky?

925
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,006
- I mean, he said he loved you.
- What?

926
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,769
Yeah, he said he loved you.

927
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,833
- Was he--
- I mean, that just seemed strange.

928
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,708
Was he translating?

929
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,849
Was he translating for me
when he said he loved you?

930
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,852
He said he loved you.

931
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:20,988
He wasn't translating.
That's how I understood him.

932
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:24,719
He was talking in English.
I was like, "What? Okay. l-- "

933
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,727
Whoa! Anthony, where are you going?

934
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:30,322
He's just a mixed-up kid!
Anthony, come on!

935
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,300
You're blowing our cover.
Maybe I didn't understand him.

936
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:35,734
I'm calling for a motel.
I don't know the area code.

937
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,635
I just know the name of the motel.

938
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:41,506
- Listen, can I borrow him a minute?
- All right. Sure.

939
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,511
I was thinking.

940
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:46,810
It might give you a feeling of security
if I went in there with you tomorrow.

941
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:49,214
You know, just for backup.

942
01:09:49,284 --> 01:09:52,014
- Huh, Chicky?
- Oh, that's right.

943
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:54,453
Well, I mean, it couldn't hurt,
could it?

944
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:57,219
No, it couldn't hurt, but--

945
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:02,592
You gotta weigh the pros and cons.
You're the one who hipped me to that.

946
01:10:02,664 --> 01:10:05,064
Shoot, well, what are the cons?

947
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,898
Cons-- if you go in there tomorrow...

948
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,939
then it's just another score
by Abe Henry.

949
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,735
That's true.

950
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,843
Can I speak to Inez, please?

951
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:20,848
She's one of the housekeepers.
She worked there for a while.

952
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:22,941
Please don't do this to me, ma'am.

953
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:25,009
Look, I'll-- Let me see what I can do.

954
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,555
Well, it's your decision.

955
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:31,115
If it's okay with you...

956
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,424
it would mean a lot to me...

957
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:37,192
if you'd let me try this one alone.

958
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,598
Damn. I'll tell you something, kid.

959
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,398
You've got the guts of a damn lion.

960
01:10:43,338 --> 01:10:44,828
Housekeeping.

961
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,898
Carmen, how's it goin'?

962
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:49,535
Yeah, I'm looking for Inez.
Have you seen her today? Is she in?

963
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:52,546
She's not here.

964
01:10:52,614 --> 01:10:54,878
Hey, man. How's it goin'?

965
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:08,628
Hello.

966
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:12,224
I'm looking for Inez.
She's one of the housekeepers.

967
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:16,237
- She is?
- Yeah, she is. Hold on.

968
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,878
- It's for you. Telephone.
- Thank you.

969
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,156
Yes!
She recognizes my voice!

970
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,386
No, I'm at a party.

971
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,691
God, you sound terrific.
How are you?

972
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,590
That's great!

973
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:48,067
No, I'm great,
especially now that I got you.

974
01:11:48,136 --> 01:11:51,435
I've been looking all over for you.
I talked to every person at the hotel.

975
01:11:51,506 --> 01:11:53,474
When am I going to see you?

976
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:57,310
Gosh, your English is really improving.

977
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:00,473
- It sounds-- You're fluent now, Inez!
- Thank you.

978
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:04,010
So the word on the street--

979
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,247
Or should I say...

980
01:12:06,321 --> 01:12:09,757
rumor has if that, well--

981
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:13,121
I heard you love me.

982
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,192
Yes, I do.

983
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:21,634
Yes!

984
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:24,638
God, Inez!

985
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,153
Bird Dog to Scarecrow.

986
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,560
- Come in.
- Go ahead, Bird Dog.

987
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:56,661
I got a visual read on you.
You're all clear.

988
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:59,366
Outstanding, Bird Dog.
Outstanding. Stand by.

989
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,466
Let's go!

990
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,340
Kumar, are you ready?

991
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,073
- Yes.
- Let's get lucky!

992
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,544
Everybody move! Let's go!
Keep up the intensity!

993
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,713
Come on!

994
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,417
Scarecrow?

995
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:19,927
- Come in, Jackknife.
- Is everything all right up there, man?

996
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:23,226
Affirmative. We're approaching
the elevator right now on my left.

997
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,459
- Stand by. Come in, Bird Dog.
- Copy.

998
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,970
- Move you your second position. Fast!
- I'm moving.

999
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:35,769
You guys take the elevator.
I'm gonna secure the stairway.

1000
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,142
- Kumar, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1001
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:41,444
I'm heading up the stairway. Everything
looks good. I just hit my knee!

1002
01:13:41,516 --> 01:13:44,314
Testing! Kumar!

1003
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,617
What? I'm okay.

1004
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,623
Stop! Get it down! Go!

1005
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,659
Let's go. Go.
Where are you goin'? Come here.

1006
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,290
Rendezvous at the checkpoint
in six minutes.

1007
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,664
Checkpoint!

1008
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:02,568
- Who's that man?
- What do you mean?

1009
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:04,571
That's Applejack! Come on!

1010
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,313
- Where we are going?
- Right down the corridor here.

1011
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,478
- Are you nervous?
- Yes, I am nervous.

1012
01:14:22,557 --> 01:14:24,320
There it is. Oh, boy.

1013
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,088
That's perfect.

1014
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:32,628
No problem.

1015
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:34,999
Hey, Jackknife, come in.

1016
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,800
- Yeah.
- You know somethin'?

1017
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,306
What?

1018
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,679
I really don't wanna do this robbery.

1019
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,978
- You know?
- Man, neither do I.

1020
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:53,043
- Do you want me to come up there?
- Keep this line clear at all times.

1021
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:54,952
Come on. Any activity, Bird Dog?

1022
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,854
Negatory. We're all clear.

1023
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:59,120
Good. It's supposed to be.

1024
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,822
I got a pretty spectacular view
from up here.

1025
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:06,994
I can see the whole city from the east
side all the way to the west side.

1026
01:15:07,068 --> 01:15:09,559
Anthony, the elevator's moving.

1027
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,799
- Who's on the elevator?
- I don't know.

1028
01:15:11,873 --> 01:15:14,239
Well, check it!
It's moving right now!

1029
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,885
Bob, what are you doing?

1030
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,187
- My walkie-talkie busted.
- Give it to me!

1031
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:33,989
- Did you drop it? Come on!
- No, I didn't drop it!

1032
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,996
You're supposed to be
on the loading dock!

1033
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:39,033
You go down there.
I'm by myself down there!

1034
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:43,135
- Move it!
- What's going on?

1035
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,298
It was Bob.
He dropped his walkie-talkie.

1036
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:48,240
Who's watching the door?
Get back in position, assholes!

1037
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,372
Applejack, talk to me.
What's going on?

1038
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,350
Somebody's coming out of there.

1039
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,216
- Look!
- Jesus Christ!

1040
01:15:59,287 --> 01:16:01,050
Hold it right there, guys!

1041
01:16:01,122 --> 01:16:02,350
- Freeze!
- Come this way.

1042
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,449
Come here! Up against this wall!
Come here!

1043
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,517
Up against this wall! Move!

1044
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,995
- Move!
- Right here!

1045
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:11,089
- Just look at the ceiling.
- Up against the wall!

1046
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,929
- What are you doing here?
- We work here!

1047
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,367
- You're always at lunch now!
- Not always.

1048
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:18,895
Yes, always!
Okay, let me think.

1049
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,602
Time!

1050
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,234
Hold on! Jesus!

1051
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:26,940
- What the hell are you doing here?
- My walkie-talkie broke, man.

1052
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:28,607
- Two minutes.
- Good.

1053
01:16:28,683 --> 01:16:31,618
- Put on your masks!
- They've already seen our faces, Dignan!

1054
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:33,119
Put on your masks!

1055
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:36,715
Kumar, we've got problems.
What are you doing sitting down?

1056
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:40,352
- I tried. I could not get it.
- You can't get it?

1057
01:16:40,428 --> 01:16:42,726
- No, I could not do it.
- Come on, man!

1058
01:16:42,797 --> 01:16:45,095
Bob, will you please put the mask on.

1059
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:46,565
- Or turn away.
- I can't get it on!

1060
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,193
Dignan, what's goin' on?

1061
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,797
- Where's Kumar?
- Forget it, then. Just forget it!

1062
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:54,865
You can't do it, because you
never knew how in the first place!

1063
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,638
You are totally lost out here!

1064
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,106
- What are you guys doin' here?
- Hold it!

1065
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:03,673
- Who are these guys?
- Jesus!

1066
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:07,912
- Jesus, Bob! What the hell--?
- Put it down, big guy!

1067
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:10,651
- What is your problem?
- I didn't do anything!

1068
01:17:11,726 --> 01:17:15,162
- Are you okay?
- Did you shoot him?

1069
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,596
He must be having a heart attack
or something!

1070
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,258
Drop your smoke.
Let's go!

1071
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:20,733
Come on!

1072
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,799
Check his pulse!

1073
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,476
- Check his pulse!
- Get to the elevator!

1074
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,843
- I can't see.
- A little more!

1075
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,472
I can't believe this!

1076
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:38,178
- I didn't shoot him.
- He's got a bum ticker, man!

1077
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:41,120
Hang in there, man.
Hang in there.

1078
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,817
Prop him up. Come on.
Get him up there.

1079
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:46,452
- Get up. Come on, man.
- He don't look good.

1080
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,726
- What is this?
- Stay calm. Stay where you are.

1081
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:54,201
- Who tripped the alarm, man?
- It's the fire alarm!

1082
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:57,830
- Who tripped the fire alarm?
- It's because of all this fuckin' smoke!

1083
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,170
Where's Kumar?

1084
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:08,706
- We're going down. Let's go!
- Man, I blew it.

1085
01:18:08,783 --> 01:18:11,479
- I blew it, man.
- What were you doing in the freezer?

1086
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,544
I don't know.
I lose my touch, man.

1087
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:16,182
Did you ever have a touch to lose, man?

1088
01:18:16,257 --> 01:18:18,316
What were you doing in there?

1089
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:20,452
Let's go!

1090
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:26,733
- Wait for Kumar.
- Come on, Kumar!

1091
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:28,735
Hurry up, Kumar!

1092
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:34,075
- Open your door.
- I can't. It's locked.

1093
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:35,666
- Open that door!
- Move!

1094
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,449
- The elevator broke.
- What?

1095
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,848
- Where's Applejack?
- He's stuck on the second floor!

1096
01:18:44,919 --> 01:18:47,387
- Between floors up there.
- Did he give you the keys?

1097
01:18:47,455 --> 01:18:49,753
- Applejack drove.
- What happened?

1098
01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:53,692
- I don't know.
- Run!

1099
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,286
Go!

1100
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,991
- What the hell happened to the plan?
- I don't know. Come on.

1101
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,761
- I'll meet you at Bob's. Go!
- What?

1102
01:18:59,834 --> 01:19:02,325
- I gotta get Applejack.
- No, you're not.

1103
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,338
- Yeah, I am.
- No!

1104
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:08,673
- I gotta fly solo on this, baby.
- Okay, Dignan--

1105
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:12,110
- I don't have time to argue now!
- I don't have time either!

1106
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,944
Now, you get back to Bob's!
Just go!

1107
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,277
Who is in charge here?

1108
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:22,755
You are, you dumb son of a bitch!
Now, please leave!

1109
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,054
Give me this one.

1110
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:28,687
You gotta give me this one.

1111
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:32,290
Dignan, you know what's gonna happen
if you go back there.

1112
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,393
No, I don't.

1113
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,961
They'll never catch me, man...

1114
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,734
'cause I'm fuckin' innocent.

1115
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:26,847
Get in here.
Concentrate on your breathing.

1116
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:29,481
You gotta get oxygen to your heart.

1117
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:37,025
I haven't got the keys.
Unlock the door!

1118
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,640
Freeze! Don't move!

1119
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:53,112
- Put your hands on the car!
- Put your hands up! Now!

1120
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,691
Drop the gun!

1121
01:21:36,124 --> 01:21:38,115
- Freeze!
- Drop it!

1122
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,127
Drop the gun!

1123
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,925
Drop the gun!

1124
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,139
Bob, there he is.

1125
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,508
One month down, twenty-three to go.

1126
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,416
Anyway, I said to the D. A. :

1127
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,684
"That cop who hit me
must have given me C. R. S. disease."

1128
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,351
- What's that?
- That's just what the D. A. asked.

1129
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,724
C. R. S. is a disease
where you can't remember shit.

1130
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:22,592
- Like amnesia.
- Right.

1131
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,633
C. R. S. "Can't remember shit." C. R. S.

1132
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,998
- Tell Mr. Henry I said that.
- Okay.

1133
01:23:30,571 --> 01:23:33,438
So is Mr. Henry gonna come by
and see me or what?

1134
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,543
I don't think so.

1135
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:39,341
He actually robbed Bob's house.

1136
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:41,609
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not.

1137
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,913
I can't believe that.

1138
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:45,919
I almost robbed that place myself.

1139
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,955
You think Applejack knew?

1140
01:23:51,025 --> 01:23:55,792
We haven't heard from Applejack
since he got out of the hospital.

1141
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:57,956
His case got dismissed.

1142
01:23:58,032 --> 01:23:59,966
- What? Why?
- We're not sure.

1143
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:02,127
We think Mr. Henry had something
to do with it.

1144
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:06,003
Well, they take the health problems
into account.

1145
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:15,442
- So what all did he get?
- Pretty much everything.

1146
01:24:15,516 --> 01:24:19,475
- I bet he got that grand piano.
- He got everything.

1147
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:22,387
I bet that grand piano's
worth ten grand.

1148
01:24:26,894 --> 01:24:29,362
I'm sorry, Bob.

1149
01:24:30,465 --> 01:24:32,797
Yeah, but you know,
in a strange way...

1150
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:35,927
it's brought me and Future Man
closer together.

1151
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:40,373
I mean, we went out
to look for a new piano the other day...

1152
01:24:40,441 --> 01:24:43,604
and he looks at me and says:
"Bob, just because you're a fuck-up...

1153
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,441
doesn't mean you're not my brother."

1154
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:53,952
That kind of touched me.

1155
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:56,217
He doesn't normally open up like that.

1156
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:01,557
- Hey, I talked to Inez last night.
- Really?

1157
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:04,257
Gonna be bringing you a care package
when she comes up here.

1158
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:07,631
- No shit?
- Yeah.

1159
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:11,798
She liked me.
Oh, yeah. Hang on to that one.

1160
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:14,398
You want anything special?

1161
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:22,274
Well--

1162
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,978
- I got something for you guys.
- Oh, yeah?

1163
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:27,487
Belt buckles that I made.

1164
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,318
There's one for you and one for you.

1165
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:33,053
I made a couple more
that I was gonna give...

1166
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:35,061
to, you know, Applejack,
Kumar or Mr. Henry.

1167
01:25:35,129 --> 01:25:37,927
But-- I don't know.
Maybe give it to Inez.

1168
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:40,024
I don't care. Give it to those guys.

1169
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:42,569
I don't have any hard feelings.

1170
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:46,095
Here's a little piece.

1171
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:48,108
That's for the tip.

1172
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,975
- Thanks.
- We did it though, didn't we?

1173
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,914
Yeah, we did it, all right.

1174
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,423
Well, thank you for comin'.

1175
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:14,926
It's good seein' you.

1176
01:26:18,739 --> 01:26:22,004
- Did you bring that grappling hook?
- Grappling hook?

1177
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:24,135
I think I might have found
a way out of here.

1178
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:26,646
- You're kidding!
- No, I'm not.

1179
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,615
- How?
- Wait for my instructions.

1180
01:26:30,651 --> 01:26:33,347
When we go through the next gate, you'll
have 30 seconds to take out the guard.

1181
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:34,479
- What?
- 30 seconds!

1182
01:26:34,555 --> 01:26:36,853
Have the car running
at the northwest checkpoint.

1183
01:26:36,924 --> 01:26:40,792
- Bob and I will scale the barricade.
- Hold on!

1184
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:45,322
And Bob, remember, shield me from
the bullets! They won't shoot civilians!

1185
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:47,196
- Are you ready?
- Hold on!

1186
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:50,294
Let's go! Now!

1187
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,078
Isn't it funny how you used to be
in the nuthouse and now I'm in jail?

1188
01:27:01,305 --> 01:27:07,764
