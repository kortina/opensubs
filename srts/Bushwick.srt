2
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:30,207
You know, we're gonna probably have
to sleep in my sister's empty room.

3
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:32,209
Probably don't even hold
my hand around around her.

4
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,336
It's gonna be good, right?

5
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:40,651
Hey, um, you told her I was coming, right?

6
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,287
I actually haven't gotten
a chance to talk to them yet.

7
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,155
Stop this.

8
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,623
Are you serious?

9
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:49,518
Just make a good impression.
They're very protective.

10
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:52,362
Oh. Oh, okay.

11
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:54,698
Oh, I see... I see the game we're playing.

12
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,767
I literally almost...
I was like, "Just leave me here.

13
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:58,735
I'm just gonna live in the subway forever."

14
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,438
- God.
- They're gonna love you.

15
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:04,174
Oh, yeah. I really hope so. Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,543
<i>...exit in an orderly fashion.</i>

17
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:09,146
<i>All service at this station is suspended.</i>

18
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:10,514
- That's weird, right?
- <i>This is an emergency.</i>

19
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:12,216
I don't know. Trains go out all the time.

20
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:14,351
At least we didn't get stuck in the tunnel.

21
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:17,488
<i>All service at this station is suspended.</i>

22
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,456
That's like a real-life thing that happens?

23
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,158
You just get stuck down there?

24
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:24,761
Yeah, one time we had a blackout,
and I had to use my phone for light.

25
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,430
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,633
That... You just described my worst
nightmare to me, just right back at me.

27
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,635
Gives me anxiety just to think
about being stuck there.

28
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,337
Why are you acting like such a baby?

29
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,506
I'm not a baby. You're a baby.
Your face is a baby.

30
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,809
But it's a normal human-being thing not to
want to get stuck underground, you know.

31
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:40,644
Why do you say I'm weird? Tell me.

32
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:42,546
Because you're not being very manly.

33
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:44,448
Aren't you supposed to be all,
you know, protective and tough?

34
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:45,816
Oh. Okay, cool.

35
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,317
I'm supposed to be protective of you.

36
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,686
I would, if I had, like, an incentive.

37
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:52,848
- Like what?
- Um, I can't think of...

38
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,393
Yeah, it feels a little better.

39
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:57,728
- Mm-hmm.
- I... Yeah.

40
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:00,230
Manlier, macho, I'd say.

41
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,590
Shut up.

42
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,471
Okay, this is a little weird.

43
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:09,198
Nobody here, huh?

44
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:15,579
- Where'd everybody go?
- I don't know.

45
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,606
They're just ahead of us, right?

46
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,652
It's probably just a drill.

47
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:23,487
- After you.
- Thank you.

48
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,114
Yeah.

49
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,058
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What the fuck?

50
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,460
Holy shit!

51
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,362
- Holy shit.
- We got to...

52
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:34,865
- No, no, no. Don't.
- What? We just leave him there?

53
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,567
All right.

54
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,402
- Um, let's just...
- Let's just...

55
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:40,704
No, no, no. Let's just go.
We got to get out of here.

56
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:43,674
- All right. What...
- Is there police around?

57
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,701
Where the fuck is everybody?

58
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,878
Let's get up to the street.

59
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:52,375
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Back up. Back up.

60
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,452
- This is not normal.
- What the hell's going on?

61
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:57,454
Something seriously must be wrong.

62
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:00,390
Holy shit.

63
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,858
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

seen anything like that.

65
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:07,364

All right.

68
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,836
No, no, no. Where are you going?

69
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,938
You stay here where it's safe.
I'm just gonna go check it out.

70
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:16,440
Honey, I'll be right back, okay?

71
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,775
- Don't. No!
- Stop.

72
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,010

73
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,521
Jose?

Ow! That fucking hurts.

- Hey!
- Fuck was that?

100
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:23,178
Motherfucker went over there.

101
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,024
- You good?
- Yeah.

102
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:30,126
Go ahead. Go ahead.

Go ahead. I got you.

Nothing.

Oh, ho, ho. Look at this. What do you think?

108
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:51,715
You think someone lives
in this fucking shithole?

109
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,750
I fucking hope not.

110
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,777
All right. Well, grab what you can.

111
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:59,989
Yo, it fucking stinks in here.

112
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,722
Old-ass shit everywhere.

113
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,928

- Yeah.

115

One, two, three.

Oh, hey! Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

Damn! Fuck, bro! She fuckin' maced me, bro!

118

Oh, yeah. And it's a bitch. Get up.

119
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,286
- Fuck her up!
- Up.

120

Ah, ah, ah. Drop it.

121
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:33,223
Drop it.

122
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:36,192
Hands on your head. Hands on your head.

123
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:38,029
Thank you.

124
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,964
It fucking burns, man.

125
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:46,102
Look at that. That's all you got?
This cheap piece of shit?

126
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:50,966
Come on, give me your fucking purse, now!

127
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,182
Fucking chump change, man.

128
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:02,311
Hey. Hey. You ain't got nothing, do you?

129
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:05,847
Get on the bed.

130
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:07,958
- No.
- N...

131
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,685
Oh. No?

132
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:12,354
No?

133
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,133
White bitch got something to say, huh?

134
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:19,035
Hey, you think you're better than us?

135
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,104
- Huh?
- No, I don't.

136
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:24,908
Bushwick is our neighborhood.

137
00:12:24,968 --> 00:12:27,711
When you white bitches gonna learn that?

138
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:29,245
I'm from here, and I'm just
trying to go home.

139
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:31,348
- Oh, you're from here? Oh.
- Look at that.

140
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,216
- Oh she's got tears.
- She's from here.

141
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:34,784
Get the fuck out of here, you're from here.

142
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:37,187
I will give you a reason to cry.

143
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,822
How about that?

144
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:42,150
Yeah. One big-ass reason.

145
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:49,699
Damn. Let's see what you got under here.

146
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,093
Looks good.

147
00:12:52,362 --> 00:12:53,737
- Oh!
- Oh! What the fuck?

148
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:55,630
Who do you think...

149
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,246
Oh, my God!

150
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:06,049
Oh! You fucking bitch.

151
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,986
Are you okay?

152
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,323
Are they dead?

153
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:40,717
- What are you doing in my house?
- I'm... I'm sorry.

154
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,052
You can't just come into
someone's house like that.

155
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:46,156
- They followed me in here.
- You need to leave.

156
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,259
- They were gonna attack me.
- You need to get out of here.

157
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,061
Do you know what's going on?

158
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,831
There's, like, a whole fucking army
out there that's just killing people.

159
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:58,268
And I was on the L train,
and there was a man...

160
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,370
Why are you out here?

161
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,807
- What?
- Why are you in Bushwick?

162
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,408
I live here.

163
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:08,437
And I'm just... I was trying to...

164
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:18,388
I'm just... I'm home from school, and I'm
trying to just get to my grandma's house,

165
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:21,825
and she just lives a couple blocks away.

166
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,993
And I...

167
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:27,197
Fuck. I was supposed to call her
when I got off the...

168
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:29,933
The cells are overloaded or blocked.

169
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,201
I don't have any cell service.

170
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,469
You're not gonna get through.

171
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,272
She's probably freaking out because I was
supposed to be there already by now.

172
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:39,375
Oh, God.

173
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:40,877
Oh, God.

174
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:43,847
Hey. Hey.

175
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,321
Can you tell me your name?

176
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,156
What's your name?

177
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,390
Hey.

178
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,118
Lucy.

179
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:58,261
Lucy.

180
00:14:58,321 --> 00:14:59,896
Hey, just do me a fav...

181
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:01,823
Don't fucking touch me.

182
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,130
Here. Have some water.

183
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,178
They declared martial law,
and my radio went dead.

184
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:17,547
Not just here, everywhere...

185
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:21,910
Boston, Chicago, D.C., Manhattan.

186
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:28,817
Is, um... Is this 9/11 again?

187
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:31,820
Terrorists?

188
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,457
No, it's different.

189
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,468
It's more tactical.

190
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:41,371
Tactical? What do you... What do you mean?

191
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:45,066
I mean it's more tactical.

192
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,404
This isn't an attack.

193
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,316
This is an invasion.

194
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,277
How do you know this?

195
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,955
I mean, this is... this is Bush... Bushwick.

196
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:00,557
Who fucking invades Bushwick?

197
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:04,419
I'm not sure who they are,
so we got to get out of here.

198
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:08,498
I...

199
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,867
This is just really fucking crazy shit.

200
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:14,462
I'm... I'm just really confused, and I just
want to know what the fuck is going on.

201
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:22,045
Strategic plan.

202
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:25,315
It's overwhelm...
overwhelming our defense system.

203
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,375
Are you a cop or something?

204
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:31,988
Janitor.

205
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:33,582
How do you know this?

206
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:40,288
I really want to just go home.

207
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,967
Good luck.

208
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:45,468
Wait, where are you going?

209
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:46,569
Hoboken.

210
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:48,129
Why?

211
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,507
My wife and my son are there.

212
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,109
Well, I just need to get to Cypress Avenue.

213
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,403
It's just a couple blocks that way.

214
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,282
Sorry. I can't help you.

215
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:01,885
No, no. Please. Don't leave me here.

216
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:03,445
Please don't leave me here.

217
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:06,615
Please.

218
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,361
The main assault's probably over.

219
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:14,631
They're gonna be canvassing block by block.

220
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,359
Just keep your head down.
You'll be all right.

221
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:26,342
Wait.

222
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:27,977
Sniper.

223
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:29,404
I got it.

224
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,341
Wait. What the fuck are you doing?

225
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:53,473
Stay down.

226
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:55,463
You're gonna get us both killed.

227
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:07,583
This is fucked up. We need to find cover.

228
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:20,455
Shit.

229
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:25,301
The school.

230
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:26,995
The school.

231
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:45,142
Oh, my God.

232
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,735
Come on.

233
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:00,462
You know where you're going?

234
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,765
I used to go to school here.

235
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,601
What's upstairs?

236
00:19:08,204 --> 00:19:10,480
There's a science lab

237
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,085
and a library and a study hall and, um...

238
00:19:16,145 --> 00:19:18,046
Can we get up to the roof?

239
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:21,791
Yeah. Teachers used to go up there and smoke.

240
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:25,228
Okay. Let's get up there
and take a look around

241
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,596
and see if we can see out on the street.

242
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:28,590
Then we get the hell out of here.

243
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:32,660
Okay.

244
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:39,966
Shit.

245
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:06,135
Do you have a compact?

246
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:07,670
What?

247
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,073
A compact, the mirror.

248
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,733
Oh, God.

249
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,203
Go.

250
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:42,271
Go, go, go ahead.

251
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:43,698
Go ahead.

252
00:21:03,352 --> 00:21:05,194
Don't shoot, please!

253
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:46,628
Shit.

254
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,632
Hold it. Hold it.

255
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:59,515
Ah! Grenade!

256
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:03,945
Oh, fuck.

257
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:07,949
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

258
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:28,511
Do you want them to figure out we're up here?

259
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:30,446
Holy shit. You're bleeding.

260
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:31,681
Yeah, I know.

261
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:33,316
I got to take care of it.

262
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:35,710
We can go over here. Let's go over here.

263
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:51,926
Oh, my God.

264
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:55,463
What are you gonna do?

265
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:59,609
Take this glass out of my leg.

266
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,003
Then cauterize this wound.

267
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:04,880
I'm gonna need you to help me.

268
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,307
What?

269
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:08,818
I can't do this.

270
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:11,520
I don't know how to cauterize a leg.

271
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,648
You... You need a doctor.

272
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:18,995
Oh!

273
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:22,498
Hold that there.
Hold it there, just like that.

274
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:23,725
All right.

275
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:32,475
All right.

276
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:33,709
Oh, God.

277
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:37,413
When I take this glass out, I'm gonna
need you to count to five for me, okay?

278
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:40,349
- Uh, uh, okay.
- Okay?

279
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:41,684
Take it out, count to five.

280
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:42,985
Okay. Yeah.

281
00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:44,762
Oh, God.

282
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:47,949
Oh, God.

283
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,327
All right, ready? Count.

284
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:52,695
One.

285
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:53,763
Two.

286
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:56,799
Three, four, five.

287
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:58,326
Five.

288
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:10,446
Now what?

289
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:12,907
I need you to do the other side for me.

290
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:16,018
- No.
- Just like I did.

291
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:18,054
- Oh, fuck.
- I need you to do it.

292
00:24:18,114 --> 00:24:19,822
I'm bleeding too much. Okay?

293
00:24:19,882 --> 00:24:21,691
Okay. Uh...

294
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,593
Just like I did. Heat the blade.

295
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:27,496
At least five seconds, okay?

296
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:29,991
No less, or it's not gonna work.

297
00:24:33,062 --> 00:24:34,537
Ready?

298
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:37,073
- All right, do it.
- Okay.

299
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,041
Do it.

300
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:40,876
Okay. Okay. Oh, God.

301
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,278
One.

302
00:24:42,338 --> 00:24:43,746
Two.

303
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,949
Three, four, five.

304
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:48,476
Five.

305
00:24:52,982 --> 00:24:55,725
Take the alcohol and pour...

306
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,761
Pour alcohol over it really good, okay?

307
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:00,755
Really good, all over it.

308
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:07,370
Oh, God. Fuck. It fucking stinks.

309
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,004
Okay.

310
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:10,998
Wrap it with that gauze.

311
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,908
Wrap it up good.

312
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,902
Nice and tight, right over the wound.

313
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:22,685
- All right.
- Okay.

314
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:26,589
Take that tape and wrap it
around there nice and tight

315
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:28,691
so that gauze won't come off... come off.

316
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:31,427
- Okay.
- Is this okay?

317
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,562
Really gonna do it like this?

318
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:34,956
Okay.

319
00:25:37,993 --> 00:25:39,535
I did it.

320
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,764
Holy shit.

321
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,434
Holy shit.

322
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,945
How'd you learn how to do that?

323
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:52,140
I watched a lot of "ER."

324
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:55,610
I watched a lot of "ER."

325
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:00,890
I was in the military.

326
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,817
I was a Marine.

327
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:06,721
Please, take that. Take it.

328
00:26:11,827 --> 00:26:12,994
What's your name?

329
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,739
Stupe.

330
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,808
- Stupe?
- Call me Stupe. Yeah.

331
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,003
Well, I don't know how to use a gun, Stupe.

332
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,508
Keep your finger off the trigger.

333
00:26:29,712 --> 00:26:32,046
- Don't point it at me.
- I'm sorry.

334
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:35,049
You look down the barrel.

335
00:26:36,652 --> 00:26:41,030
You line up the front sight
and the back sight.

336
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,570
When you're ready to shoot,
and not until you're ready to shoot,

337
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,706
you put your finger on the trigger,

338
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:53,201
and you shoot to kill.

339
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:03,953
Now, we got to get out of here.
Are you ready?

340
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:06,047
Wait, are you sure you can?

341
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,625
Yeah. I'm good.

342
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:10,960
You worry about you.

343
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,761
There's a fire escape. Come on.

344
00:27:12,821 --> 00:27:14,055
All right.

345
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,513
Holy fuck.

346
00:27:55,197 --> 00:27:57,298
We're not gonna make it, are we?

347
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:01,577
We'll make it one block at a time.

348
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:05,047
Who are they?

349
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:07,074
I don't know.

350
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:09,952
What if it's not just Brooklyn?

351
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:12,755
What if they're in Hoboken, too,
where your family's at?

352
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,094
My family's safe.

353
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:20,129
Come on.

354
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:45,754
We can go to Mr. Argo's It's right there.

355
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:47,181
Right there.

356
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,753
Yo, it's all free now. Stock up.

357
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:21,790
Is there any new info?

358
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,225
Who cares? Just take whatever you want.

359
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:24,226
Don't ask questions.

360
00:29:24,286 --> 00:29:27,129
Hey, yo. Let's go.

361
00:29:27,189 --> 00:29:28,797
Are they saying who's doing this?

362
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:30,866
You have a gun. You figure it out. Peace.

363
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:32,701
<i>The militants are American.</i>

364
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:34,103
<i>We don't know that, Fran.</i>

365
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:37,406
<i>We don't know anything more than
the unreliable eyewitness accounts,</i>

366
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:39,942
<i>and we just don't have
an official word as of yet.</i>

367
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:41,977
<i>Why are we being kept in
the dark about all this?</i>

368
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:45,681
<i>Why is it so important to keep
the public unaware of our situation?</i>

369
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:47,282
<i>Oh, you've got to be joking.</i>

370
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:50,185
<i>What you're insinuating
is paranoid and delusional.</i>

371
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:53,789
<i>I'm saying that, over the last few
years, certain politicians have lied</i>

372
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:55,724
<i>and swindled and cheated
their way into office,</i>

373
00:29:55,784 --> 00:29:58,060
<i>and this... this kind of domestic terrorism</i>

374
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,195
<i>is not such an illogical conclusion.</i>

375
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,698
<i>We expect to hear from the president shortly.</i>

376
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,768
<i>The government has issued
some initial guidelines.</i>

377
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:07,002
<i>Stay inside.</i>

378
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:09,171
<i>Do not answer the door.</i>

379
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:12,741
<i>The U.S. military will be
setting up extraction points.</i>

380
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:15,344
<i>This information is coming in
very sporadically.</i>

381
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:16,712
<i>We'll keep broadcasting as we get more info.</i>

382
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:17,647
The fucking government.

383
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:19,381
<i>Bridges and tunnels are closed.</i>

384
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:21,684
- Useless as usual.
- <i>JFK and LaGuardia are closed.</i>

385
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:23,252
They got to realize how fucked up this is.

386
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:24,820
<i>Logan Airport is closed.</i>

387
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,355
My grandmother is not gonna understand.

388
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:28,123
If soldiers come to her house,
she's not gonna leave.

389
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:30,092
We have to get there before they do.

390
00:30:30,152 --> 00:30:31,827
Is she close?

391
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:34,029
She's about a block and a half
on Willoughby Street.

392
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:39,927
Did you hear that?

393
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:42,730
Mr. Argo?

394
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:54,783
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Mr. Argo, what happened?

395
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:58,787
Candy, they stole candy, fucking candy.

396
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:02,991
I didn't try to stop them,
but he still stabbed me.

397
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,359
Those guys? They...

398
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,328
Yes.

399
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:09,123
Ohh. It's all a game to them.

400
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:13,769
Mr. Argo?

401
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:16,505
Shit. Mr. Argo?

402
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:23,045
Lucy. Lucy, we got to get
the fuck out of here.

403
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,774
Okay.

404
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:05,387
My grandmother's house is that way.

405
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:06,814
Let's go.

406
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,292
Oh, God. Shit.

407
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:30,179
Dude, get the fucking bags.
We got to get out of here.

408
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:35,342
We fucked that guy up, some old dude.

409
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:37,586
Yo, man, got the keys.

410
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:39,555
- Got the keys.
- We got to go.

411
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:44,418
Dragging your ass, man.
Come on, come on, come on.

412
00:32:46,054 --> 00:32:48,197
Yo, come on, man. Let's go.

413
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:50,165
What the fuck?

414
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:51,734
Fuck!

415
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:54,403
Drive, drive, drive.

416
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:57,906
Oh, my God.

417
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:02,477
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

418
00:33:02,537 --> 00:33:04,847
Oh, God. We need to stop the bleeding.

419
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:06,315
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

420
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,549
What the hell were you thinking?

421
00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:11,620
Are you hit anywhere else?

422
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,522
No.

423
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:16,058
God damn it. What were you thinking?

424
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:17,326
Fuck.

425
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:22,865
My finger. There's so much blood.

426
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,533
Oh, my God.

427
00:33:24,593 --> 00:33:27,069
We'll fix it when we get to your
grandmother's house, all right?

428
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:28,604
Come on. We got to keep moving.

429
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:30,898
Damn it.

430
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,875
That's the guy that stabbed Mr. Argo.

431
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:46,080
He fucking killed Mr. Argo for no reason.

432
00:33:47,382 --> 00:33:49,617
He was gonna shoot this guy, too.

433
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,453
What are you doing?

434
00:33:53,355 --> 00:33:55,197
Giving these to help with the pain.

435
00:33:55,257 --> 00:33:56,932
We can't just leave him here.

436
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,166
- We can't just leave him.
- We can't help him.

437
00:33:58,226 --> 00:34:00,094
We got to keep moving!

438
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,910
Let's go. Let's go!

439
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,536
Okay. Okay.

440
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,483
We're coming in. Open the door.

441
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:50,352
We will use force.

442
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:52,154
This is an order.

443
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,964
Grandma, where are you?

444
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:04,333
Grandma? She must be upstairs.

445
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:09,063
Grandma? Hello?

446
00:35:26,448 --> 00:35:27,982
Lucy?

447
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,135
Her heart wasn't very strong.

448
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:54,516
I'm so sorry.

449
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:57,277
I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

450
00:36:01,183 --> 00:36:03,150
Oh, God.

451
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,695
Oh, God.

452
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:10,090
We should... We should get her off the floor.

453
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:13,794
Oh, God.

454
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:37,084
Fuck! God!

455
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:07,614
Gonna check the front,
see how much time we have.

456
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:11,318
Here, take these.

457
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,096
They'll help you and your hand.

458
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:15,622
I'll be right back.

459
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:55,203
The neighborhood is fighting back.

460
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:56,763
We got a few minutes.

461
00:37:57,399 --> 00:38:00,742
Get that hand fixed up,
get the fuck out of here.

462
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:19,319
Is it bad?

463
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:22,890
Is it bad?

464
00:38:23,892 --> 00:38:25,893
Looks like we stopped a lot of bleeding.

465
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:42,276
Ow, ow. Shit.

466
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:44,645
Fuck.

467
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,183
Oh, God. You're such an asshole.

468
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:51,785
That's what my wife says.

469
00:38:54,789 --> 00:38:57,224
Your wife is a very smart lady.

470
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,632
Bet you can't wait to see her and your kid.

471
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:13,440
What did you do in the military?

472
00:39:14,509 --> 00:39:17,619
- I was a hospital coroner.
- Ow! Oh, my God!

473
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,454
Oh, my God.

474
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:21,823
A medic.

475
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:32,567
So you were a medic. Now you're a janitor.

476
00:39:32,627 --> 00:39:34,436
That's good.

477
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:36,438
Tired of watching people die.

478
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:50,978
Oh, God.

479
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:56,291
I feel weird. I feel really weird.

480
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,618
Like...

481
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:00,495
I feel like my...

482
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:04,566
my insides are, like, floating.

483
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:06,434
It feels good. It feels...

484
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:08,970
I'm not complaining, but it just...

485
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,605
I don't know what's going on.

486
00:40:10,665 --> 00:40:11,898
I just...

487
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:14,843
Oh, my God.

488
00:40:14,903 --> 00:40:17,412
Oh, my God.

489
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:20,374
What am I gonna do when I get married?

490
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:24,845
Jose.

491
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,449
I guess it doesn't
really matter anymore, huh?

492
00:40:30,618 --> 00:40:32,761
Why God gave you two hands, right?

493
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:35,897
Got nine fingers left.

494
00:40:42,497 --> 00:40:44,464
Do you believe in God?

495
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:48,076
I do.

496
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:49,836
I believe in God.

497
00:40:54,976 --> 00:40:56,843
Thank you for helping me.

498
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:02,316
Who said I was helping you?

499
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:05,760
Open the door.

500
00:41:20,502 --> 00:41:22,476
Is there another way out?

501
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:23,870
The basement.

502
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:33,985
Lucy!

503
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:16,798
Oh, I feel really sick.

504
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:29,644
My sister's house is that way.
We're gonna go that way.

505
00:42:29,704 --> 00:42:31,546
No. The soldiers went that way.

506
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:32,914
No. We're gonna go that way.
We're gonna get my sister.

507
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:34,816
Come on. Let's go.

508
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,576
Well, I'm going.

509
00:42:38,746 --> 00:42:40,522
Lucy!

510
00:42:40,582 --> 00:42:41,815
Fuck!

511
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:44,818
Goddamn it.

512
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:11,553
Fuck are you doing?

513
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:18,159
My sister lives here.

514
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:19,702
Okay?

515
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:58,600
- Hey.
- Hi.

516
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,235
- Who the fuck is that guy?
- No, no, no.

517
00:44:00,295 --> 00:44:01,836
- Who the fuck is that guy?
- Shut her up.

518
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:03,071
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Shut her up.

519
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:04,606
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
- Lucy!

520
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:06,207
- Will you shut her up?
- No, no, no. Stop.

521
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:09,110
Calm down. Relax. Listen to me.

522
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,778
- Get out!
- No, no, no. Listen to me.

523
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:13,047
Jose is dead, and this guy
saved me from these...

524
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:14,282
- He's a friend.
- What?

525
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:16,050
Are you on drugs? Did he fucking drug you?

526
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,719
- No.
- Motherfucker!

527
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:20,288
Hey, do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

528
00:44:20,348 --> 00:44:22,156
What? No. I've been asleep.

529
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:24,125
The fucking neighbors have been
blasting "Call of Duty" all day,

530
00:44:24,185 --> 00:44:25,560
and it just woke me up.

531
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,897
You haven't heard any of these helicopters
or anything that's been going on?

532
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,933
Lucy, there's always helicopters.

533
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:33,835
This is Brooklyn. You've been
gone too long, college girl.

534
00:44:33,895 --> 00:44:35,695
Listen, listen. Sit down. Sit.

535
00:44:36,998 --> 00:44:38,873
Okay. I want you to pay attention to me.

536
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,675
Why are you being so serious?

537
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:43,177
I was thrown on the ground
and zip-tied by this soldier,

538
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:45,947
and then there was these two guys
that followed me into this basement.

539
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:48,942
And then this guy, he helped me.
He saved my life.

540
00:44:51,913 --> 00:44:54,088
What? This is...

541
00:44:54,148 --> 00:44:56,591
This is... This is too much.

542
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:59,794
My... My brain is gonna melt.

543
00:44:59,854 --> 00:45:02,222
This is... Lucy, this is too much.

544
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:10,705
I mean, Lucy, I think you're
just a little too high, man.

545
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:12,874
- But...
- No. I'm not on any...

546
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:16,077
I mean, I... Well, I am on drugs.

547
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:18,938
I'm on drugs that he gave me
for my finger, but that's it.

548
00:45:23,644 --> 00:45:24,886
All right. I'm gonna...

549
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:28,156
I'm gonna go get my shit together,
and then when I get back,

550
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:31,025
you and me and him,
we're getting out of here.

551
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:32,994
We're gonna get somewhere safe, okay?

552
00:45:35,823 --> 00:45:37,832
What about Grandma?

553
00:45:37,892 --> 00:45:39,601
She's gone.

554
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:41,903
No. What?

555
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:43,671
What?

556
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:45,239
- What?
- I didn't know what to do.

557
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:46,941
- No.
- I'm sorry.

558
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,377
Okay.

559
00:45:49,437 --> 00:45:50,878
- I'll be right back.
- Lucy.

560
00:45:50,938 --> 00:45:52,839
Hey, keep an eye on her for me.

561
00:46:48,062 --> 00:46:51,172
That was Oswaldo.

562
00:46:51,232 --> 00:46:54,842
I left the little latch thing open,

563
00:46:54,902 --> 00:46:56,244
and he got out.

564
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:59,406
Yeah. They'll do that.

565
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:06,454
What are you...

566
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:08,948
Are you trying to fuck my sister?

567
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:14,929
You're sisters?

568
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:18,066
Yeah. My grandma...

569
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,468
My grandma raised us, so we're sisters.

570
00:47:20,528 --> 00:47:25,398
So don't you try and fuck with
my sister or fuck my sister.

571
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:29,911
- I'm not trying to fuck her.
- Oh, yeah?

572
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:32,380
I'm just trying to get through the day.

573
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,308
What are you taking pills for?
What's wrong with you?

574
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:42,023
I shot a guy. I crushed a guy.

575
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:46,086
I got glass in my leg, hurts. Needs help.

576
00:47:48,089 --> 00:47:50,256
You, like, a soldier?

577
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,202
I'm a janitor.

578
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:57,138
A janitor? Right.

579
00:47:58,098 --> 00:47:59,807
I like soldiers.

580
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:04,337
Hey, what do you think?

581
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,410
It's a cat.

582
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,180
It's a happy pussy.

583
00:48:15,883 --> 00:48:19,393
Meow.

584
00:48:19,453 --> 00:48:21,263
Meow.

585
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:29,570
- What the fuck?
- Don't even fucking think about it.

586
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,171
Why are you coming in here?

587
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,007
Are you alone?

588
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:49,023
Don't come in my house!

589
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,518
Lucy, make sure no one
comes up through that window.

590
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:48,041
You speak English?

591
00:49:52,112 --> 00:49:53,279
Hey.

592
00:49:54,582 --> 00:49:56,516
Where are you from?

593
00:49:58,986 --> 00:50:01,095
Kentucky, sir.

594
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,327
You're an American?

595
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:12,240
What the fuck is going on?

596
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,976
Texas is seceding from the United States.

597
00:50:15,036 --> 00:50:16,611
Bullshit.

598
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:19,447
By the order of the fathers
of the New American Coalition.

599
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:22,116
We are a united force
with the goal of establishing

600
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:25,019
an independent nation,
free from government tyranny

601
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,155
and the right to live our lives
the true American way.

602
00:50:28,215 --> 00:50:30,625
Yeah. That makes perfect fucking sense.

603
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:33,152
- Sir?
- Who's "we"?

604
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,000
Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina,

605
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,936
South Carolina, West Virginia,
and Georgia are with us.

606
00:50:41,996 --> 00:50:45,039
Parts of Maryland and
Pennsylvania are on the brink.

607
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:47,408
It's like a... like a new Civil War?

608
00:50:49,203 --> 00:50:51,979
I served with... with good men
from those states.

609
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,982
Yeah. We're a private army.

610
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,643
Mercenaries?

611
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,545
What's the plan?

612
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:05,693
We'll force Congress to ratify the secession.

613
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:09,130
Well, how are you gonna do that?

614
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,992
This... This is how we're
gonna do that, insurgency.

615
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,299
What's the plan here in New York?

616
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:24,312
We were just supposed to lock
down Bushwick, round people up.

617
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,713
No one gets hurt.

618
00:51:25,773 --> 00:51:30,084
Establish a green zone for further operations
and wait for the president to fold.

619
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:35,089
We, uh... We didn't anticipate
so much resistance from...

620
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:37,625
resistance from a designated soft spot.

621
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:39,585
And why the hell is that?

622
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:43,297
Ethno-diversity, sir.

623
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:46,300
Racist motherfucker.

624
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,370
I ain't racist. It's fact.

625
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,706
This racist pig fucker thinks

626
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:55,543
that because there's so many minorities
here in Brooklyn that we won't fight back?

627
00:51:55,603 --> 00:51:57,478
Well, how's that working out for you?

628
00:51:57,538 --> 00:51:59,013
How? How is that working out?

629
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:01,607
- Our intel told us...
- Fuck your intel.

630
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:06,187
There weren't supposed to be so many guns.

631
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:08,723
They're illegal here.

632
00:52:08,783 --> 00:52:12,026
Welcome to New York, stupid motherfucker.

633
00:52:12,086 --> 00:52:17,423
Once we got blowback, they gave us orders
to shoot on sight if our lives were in danger.

634
00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:20,234
Killing innocent Americans.

635
00:52:20,294 --> 00:52:22,303
I'm just following orders. I'm a soldier.

636
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:24,505
- What'd you say?
- I'm a soldier, sir.

637
00:52:24,565 --> 00:52:26,640
You don't get to call yourself
a fucking soldier.

638
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,042
You're not a soldier!

639
00:52:28,102 --> 00:52:31,212
Sir, I'm sorry, sir. Sir, please.

640
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:35,174
Please, I was just... just following orders.

641
00:52:38,612 --> 00:52:40,321
Who's in charge?

642
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:44,225
Who's the fucking asshole who sent you
and all your dumbass buddies

643
00:52:44,285 --> 00:52:46,686
out here to get yourselves
killed for nothing?

644
00:52:51,826 --> 00:52:53,634
No. Nothing.

645
00:52:53,694 --> 00:52:56,270
It doesn't matter. You're a mindless fuck.

646
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:57,671
Why would you question your orders?

647
00:52:57,731 --> 00:52:59,373
You were in the military, right?
You understand.

648
00:52:59,433 --> 00:53:01,534
- I can't be second-guessing...
- Shut up.

649
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:06,806
Where's the DMZ?

650
00:53:09,643 --> 00:53:13,346
- Where's the goddamn DMZ?
- Fuck you. I ain't telling you.

651
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:18,092
I know where the DMV is.

652
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:21,328
The DMZ.

653
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:23,631
What's the DMZ?

654
00:53:23,691 --> 00:53:26,300
It's a demilitarized zone.

655
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,737
It's where our troops are embedded,
where they're getting people out.

656
00:53:29,797 --> 00:53:31,539
And you're gonna fucking tell me.

657
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,474
I'm tired of playing games with you.

658
00:53:33,534 --> 00:53:36,610
You have three fucking seconds, or
I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off.

659
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,813
- Please, sir.
- One, two...

660
00:53:38,873 --> 00:53:41,541
Grover Cleveland Park in Queens.

661
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,186
The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard

662
00:53:45,246 --> 00:53:48,522
are evacuating noncombatants
from there, the ones that make it.

663
00:53:48,582 --> 00:53:49,790
The ones you don't kill first.

664
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,659
No one was supposed to fight back, okay?

665
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:54,261
We had too many casualties.
They gave us orders.

666
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:57,498
They told us Bushwick was a
shoot-to-kill zone, us or them.

667
00:53:57,558 --> 00:53:59,300
And we were just supposed to fucking take it?

668
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,402
Those were our orders.

669
00:54:01,462 --> 00:54:03,137
It's not my fault.

670
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:05,264
Fuck your orders.

671
00:54:10,204 --> 00:54:11,178
- Sir...
- Fuck you.

672
00:54:11,238 --> 00:54:12,538
Sir, please...

673
00:54:20,214 --> 00:54:21,547
Cleveland Park.

674
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:27,286
Three or five blocks at the most.

675
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,490
We don't have much daylight.

676
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,626
What do you want to do?

677
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:37,230
It's up to me now?

678
00:54:40,301 --> 00:54:42,301
My leg's fucked.

679
00:54:43,404 --> 00:54:45,538
What do you want to do?

680
00:54:47,841 --> 00:54:50,851
Okay. We're getting out of here.

681
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:52,520
Is it safe to go out there?

682
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,655
Probably not, but it's not safe in here.

683
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:56,757
Can I get a gun?

684
00:54:56,817 --> 00:54:58,284
No.

685
00:55:03,524 --> 00:55:06,159
What are we gonna do about him?

686
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:14,734
Ah!

687
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:22,249
- Let's go!
- Okay.

688
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:23,751
Just in case he comes back.

689
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,504
Oh, my God.

690
00:55:52,406 --> 00:55:54,248
Oh, my God. This is real.

691
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:59,320
I didn't know it was this bad.

692
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:32,720
I didn't know those guys could fight.

693
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,356
Come on. Let's go. Move.

694
00:56:43,857 --> 00:56:46,967
<i># If I died in my apartment
like a rat in a cage #</i>

695
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:48,535
<i># Would the neighbors smell the corpse #</i>

696
00:56:48,595 --> 00:56:50,704
<i># Before the cat ate my face? #</i>

697
00:56:50,764 --> 00:56:52,706
Dead yet, pussy?

698
00:56:52,766 --> 00:56:56,310
<i># I'm trying to jettison the ballast
With the hazardous waste #</i>

699
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,412
Sit your ass down.

700
00:56:58,472 --> 00:57:01,415
<i># Steep in a self-imposed

703
00:57:07,114 --> 00:57:09,757
Fuck! These streets
are crawling with soldiers.

704
00:57:10,617 --> 00:57:12,559
Let's make a run for it.

705
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:14,928
Yo, we got to go upstairs.

706
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:29,035
Inside, go.

707
00:57:38,479 --> 00:57:40,054
Who the fuck are you?!

708
00:57:40,114 --> 00:57:42,089
- Put your fucking guns down.
- Don't shoot.

709
00:57:42,149 --> 00:57:43,657
- Put your fucking guns down.
- Don't shoot.

710
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:45,059
Put the fucking guns down.

711
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,727
Don't shoot. We're just...

712
00:57:46,787 --> 00:57:48,796
We're just...

713
00:57:49,456 --> 00:57:51,932
We're just trying to stay alive. Okay?

714
00:57:51,992 --> 00:57:53,434
Put your fucking guns down.

715
00:57:53,494 --> 00:57:55,569
Okay. Everybody relax.

716
00:57:55,629 --> 00:57:57,471
Okay? Just relax.

717
00:57:57,531 --> 00:57:58,764
Okay?

718
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:02,001
Chill.

719
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,012
Okay. All right.

720
00:58:05,072 --> 00:58:07,514
What the fuck are you doing in our building?

721
00:58:07,574 --> 00:58:09,083
You don't know what's going on out there?

722
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:14,621
Look... if we can all just get
to Cleveland Park,

723
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:16,457
the U.S. Army is evacuating
people out of here.

724
00:58:16,517 --> 00:58:18,692
- We can get out of here.
- That what you heard?

725
00:58:18,752 --> 00:58:20,127
What does he mean?

726
00:58:20,187 --> 00:58:21,729
What does that mean? Whoa!

727
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,664
What the fuck is wrong with you, James?

728
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:25,032
Shut up, Ma.

729
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:28,001
Get your dumb asses up here and sit down.

730
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:29,962
I said now!

731
00:58:30,831 --> 00:58:33,006
Go! Hurry up.

732
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:34,533
Whoa.

733
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:03,103
The United States Army is set up
at a park over in Ridgewood,

734
00:59:03,163 --> 00:59:08,033
helicopters, tanks, whatever else.

735
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:12,146
Some people know better than to stick around

736
00:59:12,206 --> 00:59:14,815
in a war zone, James.

737
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:17,651
You don't remember the '70s.

738
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:20,954
Eventually, they gonna
get us all out of here.

739
00:59:21,014 --> 00:59:24,792
But we... Right now, we can't get to them.

740
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,593
Coalition fuckers in the way.

741
00:59:26,653 --> 00:59:29,496
- Ain't shit, Ma.
- Shut up, now, James.

742
00:59:29,556 --> 00:59:31,999
My boys are tough,
but they ain't tough enough

743
00:59:32,059 --> 00:59:35,836
to get through that blockade by themselves.

744
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:39,072
Ma'am, we're not gonna
be enough to fight them.

745
00:59:39,132 --> 00:59:41,008
I'm not talking about you.

746
00:59:41,068 --> 00:59:43,744
Two blocks over, Church of God,

747
00:59:43,804 --> 00:59:48,715
we heard they got 30, 40 people
all riled up and ready to go.

748
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:50,584
So what's the problem?

749
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:53,854
James, you want to tell these nice folks

750
00:59:53,914 --> 00:59:57,858
why we can't go and ask Father John for help?

751
00:59:57,918 --> 00:59:59,827
We got issues.

752
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,762
They need our help.

753
01:00:01,822 --> 01:00:04,998
They got some people,
but they ain't got enough guns.

754
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:08,035
Well, it just so happens that right here,

755
01:00:08,095 --> 01:00:09,803
- down in this basement...
- Ma.

756
01:00:09,863 --> 01:00:11,939
...my boy and his little club...

757
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:14,608
- It's a gang.
- ...they got all kinds

758
01:00:14,668 --> 01:00:17,644
of weapons... knives, guns, bullets...

759
01:00:17,704 --> 01:00:21,615
for their little dick-swinging gang bullshit.

760
01:00:21,675 --> 01:00:22,916
Ma, they can't have our guns.

761
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:24,910
Oh, yes, they can.

762
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:28,881
This is what we gonna do.

763
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:33,627
James heads over there
and tells them we got they back,

764
01:00:33,687 --> 01:00:35,062
he gets shot.

765
01:00:35,122 --> 01:00:38,665
Me? I wouldn't make it
halfway down the block.

766
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:40,025
But...

767
01:00:44,197 --> 01:00:50,210
...this sweet little white girl,
she gonna go for us.

768
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,778
No.

769
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:53,747
You two are gonna stay here for insurance.

770
01:00:53,807 --> 01:00:55,082
- No.
- No. I'm...

771
01:00:55,142 --> 01:00:57,050
You can't send her out there alone.

772
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,619
I'm not doing that.

773
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:01,622
I go with her or no deal.

774
01:01:01,682 --> 01:01:05,025
I don't recall offering you a deal.

775
01:01:05,085 --> 01:01:07,586
- I'm not going.
- Look. Look, ma'am.

776
01:01:08,355 --> 01:01:11,832
You send her out there alone,
she's just gonna get herself killed.

777
01:01:11,892 --> 01:01:14,535
That's not gonna do
anybody any good, so just...

778
01:01:14,595 --> 01:01:17,997
You let me go with her.
We'll figure it out, all right?

779
01:01:19,132 --> 01:01:20,941
I'm not leaving my sister.

780
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:22,301
- Please?
- Lucy.

781
01:01:24,738 --> 01:01:26,071
Please?

782
01:01:27,307 --> 01:01:31,985
Your sister will be fine.

783
01:01:32,045 --> 01:01:36,590
You and your bodyguard go tell Father
John we'll meet him at the Laundromat.

784
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,626
Tell him we're going there right now.

785
01:01:39,686 --> 01:01:41,028
You'll see your sister in no time.

786
01:01:41,088 --> 01:01:43,830
- No. No. No.
- No.

787
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:46,066
James, show these people the front door.

788
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:48,602
- No. No. No!
- Let's go. Come on.

789
01:01:48,662 --> 01:01:49,970
- Come on.
- No!

790
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:51,338
- Hurry up.
- Come on. God damn it.

791
01:01:51,398 --> 01:01:52,906
- Lucy!
- Shut the fuck up.

792
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:54,775
- Shit!
- Get off me.

793
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:56,109
Why are you doing this?

794
01:01:56,169 --> 01:01:57,344
Don't fuck around. Do what I tell you to do.

795
01:01:57,404 --> 01:02:00,013
- Don't you fucking touch her.
- Oh, this isn't right, man.

796
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:02,916
We're all from the same neighborhood.
We got to stick together.

797
01:02:02,976 --> 01:02:04,217
We're not from the same neighborhood.

798
01:02:04,277 --> 01:02:07,346
At least give us our guns, man.
Don't send us out there without our guns.

799
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:13,026
Take your fucking guns.
You better meet me at the Laundromat.

800
01:02:13,086 --> 01:02:14,728
Holy shit.

801
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:17,363
It's getting worse.

802
01:02:21,995 --> 01:02:23,963
How are we gonna get Belinda back?

803
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,097
Are you okay? Do you need help?

804
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:51,690
Can you walk?

805
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:10,643
Thank you for helping. Deborah.

806
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:20,794
- Whose street?
- Our street.

807
01:03:20,854 --> 01:03:22,896

- Our street.

808

- Our street.

815
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,279
- Whose street?
- Our street.

816
01:03:39,339 --> 01:03:40,881
Whose street?

817
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,885
Lucy.

818
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:33,066
Bushwick!

819
01:04:39,032 --> 01:04:41,300
Go, go, go.

820
01:04:44,137 --> 01:04:47,147
Come on. Come on. Come on. Go inside.

821
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:50,409
Come on. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

822
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:11,930
Jesus.

823
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,209
Do you see him?

824
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:17,944
No.

825
01:05:18,004 --> 01:05:19,946
He's got to be here somewhere.

826
01:05:20,006 --> 01:05:21,815
Well, let's find him.

827
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:23,950
Have you seen Father John?

828
01:05:35,121 --> 01:05:37,556
Take these over there
to that woman, all right?

829
01:05:40,427 --> 01:05:42,194
I'll be right back.

830
01:05:48,468 --> 01:05:50,477
Why don't you see if you can find him?

831
01:05:50,537 --> 01:05:52,512
I'm going to help out around here.

832
01:06:11,892 --> 01:06:14,067
Um, excuse me. Where is Father John?

833
01:06:14,127 --> 01:06:17,863
Um, we've seen a few priests,
don't know their names.

834
01:06:25,538 --> 01:06:28,415
Excuse me. Are you Father John?

835
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:30,016
Who are you?

836
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:32,252
There's a group,
and they have a lot of weapons.

837
01:06:32,312 --> 01:06:35,247
- And they sent me here...
- I'm not Father John.

838
01:06:36,616 --> 01:06:41,461
He's praying downstairs.

839
01:06:41,521 --> 01:06:44,130
Right through those doors.

840
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,858
Thank you.

841
01:07:09,215 --> 01:07:10,924
Father John?

842
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:14,987
Hello?

843
01:07:19,092 --> 01:07:20,659
Father John?

844
01:07:25,665 --> 01:07:27,466
Hello?

845
01:07:30,403 --> 01:07:33,046
Multitudes in the valley of decision.

846
01:07:33,106 --> 01:07:36,549
For the day of the Lord is near
in the valley of decision.

847
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:39,286
The sun and the moon grow dark.

848
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,188
Excuse me. Hi.

849
01:07:42,248 --> 01:07:44,950
I'm looking for Father John.

850
01:07:50,523 --> 01:07:52,999
I am Father John.

851
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:54,301
Oh, okay.

852
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:57,604
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

853
01:07:57,664 --> 01:08:00,373
We need to go to the Laundromat,

854
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:04,144
and there's a woman on
Starr Street with her son and...

855
01:08:04,204 --> 01:08:06,546
Is anyone among you sick?

856
01:08:06,606 --> 01:08:08,014
Sick?

857
01:08:08,074 --> 01:08:09,482
No. Wait.

858
01:08:09,542 --> 01:08:13,253
Let him call for the elders of the church.

859
01:08:13,313 --> 01:08:15,689
- I...
- And they will pray over him,

860
01:08:15,749 --> 01:08:18,591
anointing him with oil
in the name of the Father

861
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:20,393
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

862
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:21,995
I don't know what you're talking about.

863
01:08:22,055 --> 01:08:24,230
We need your help. We have to go.

864
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,732
You don't understand.

865
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:32,272
The prayer of faith
will save the one who is sick,

866
01:08:32,332 --> 01:08:35,133
and the Lord will raise him up.

867
01:08:36,536 --> 01:08:40,213
If he is guilty of sin, he will be forgiven.

868
01:08:40,273 --> 01:08:41,715
Oh, shit!

869
01:08:41,775 --> 01:08:43,316
Fuck!

870
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:44,684
Oh, my God.

871
01:08:44,744 --> 01:08:46,453
You stupid...

872
01:08:48,114 --> 01:08:50,390
Oh, my God. Shit.

873
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,737
- Did you find Father John?
- He's, um... He's gone.

874
01:09:37,797 --> 01:09:39,139
What do you mean, he's gone?

875
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,607
We have to go. We have to go now.

876
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,275
Father John wouldn't leave this congregation.

877
01:09:42,335 --> 01:09:43,343
- He's gone. We have to go.
- You didn't answer me.

878
01:09:43,403 --> 01:09:44,611
Is Father John okay?

879
01:09:44,671 --> 01:09:46,546
He did it to himself.

880
01:09:56,549 --> 01:09:59,059
Okay. Listen. Listen up.

881
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:01,795
Um, it's not going to be safe
here for very much longer.

882
01:10:01,855 --> 01:10:03,596
So we need to... we need to go.

883
01:10:03,656 --> 01:10:06,499
Anybody who is able, please
help somebody who's injured.

884
01:10:06,559 --> 01:10:09,269
We are going to all meet at the
Laundromat on Cypress Avenue,

885
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:12,572
where we will meet a group of people that
have a lot of weapons, and from there,

886
01:10:12,632 --> 01:10:17,277
we are going to get to the evacuation
helicopters inside Cleveland Park.

887
01:10:17,337 --> 01:10:20,346
We need to stick together,
but we need to go now.

888
01:10:25,411 --> 01:10:26,853
Stupe, come on. Let's go.

889
01:10:26,913 --> 01:10:28,421
- What happened to Father John?
- We have to go now.

890
01:10:28,481 --> 01:10:30,156
- No. He's gone.
- I can't just leave him...

891
01:10:30,216 --> 01:10:31,357
We have to go. We have to go now.

892
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:32,625
- Just let me finish this.
- No.

893
01:10:32,685 --> 01:10:34,327
Stupe, come on.

894
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:36,162
His shoulder is fucked.

895
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:39,232
Jesus. Go. Go. Go. Stupe.

896
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:40,733
Just give me two minutes. God damn it.

897
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:42,569
I will meet you by the front door. Come on.

898
01:10:42,629 --> 01:10:44,696
Lucy! Shit.

899
01:10:45,698 --> 01:10:47,566
Come on. Let's go.

900
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,014
Open this fucking door!

901
01:11:09,722 --> 01:11:11,631
Open the door!

902
01:11:16,461 --> 01:11:17,871
Oh, shit.

903
01:11:26,906 --> 01:11:28,740
Stand down.

904
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:53,873
Shit.

905
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:56,743
Holy shit. Are you okay?

906
01:11:56,803 --> 01:11:58,278
Yeah. I'm okay.

907
01:11:58,338 --> 01:12:00,813
Yes, yes. I can get up. I'm okay.

908
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,575
Let's go.

909
01:12:05,378 --> 01:12:07,420
Ouch.

910
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,190
Let's go. Let's get the fuck out of here.

911
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,592
Come on. Go. Go. Move.

912
01:12:12,652 --> 01:12:14,727
I just killed a guy with an ax.

913
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,777
Where is everybody?

914
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,615
I don't know.

915
01:13:17,884 --> 01:13:19,792
Are we supposed to meet them inside?

916
01:13:19,852 --> 01:13:21,928
Are we supposed to meet them outside?

917
01:13:21,988 --> 01:13:25,398
We were just with everybody,
and where did they go?

918
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:27,567
How long do you think it's gonna
take for Belinda to get here?

919
01:13:27,627 --> 01:13:29,828
I don't fucking know!

920
01:13:31,331 --> 01:13:34,507
Can you be patient for one fucking second?

921
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:36,943
I don't want to be here any more than you do.

922
01:14:30,923 --> 01:14:33,825
So what year of college are you?

923
01:14:38,865 --> 01:14:41,066
Second-year grad student.

924
01:14:44,904 --> 01:14:46,805
What are you studying?

925
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:50,442
Civil engineering.

926
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:54,854
That's great. That's great.

927
01:14:54,914 --> 01:14:58,783
You'll be able to help make a difference.

928
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:02,061
That's great.

929
01:15:10,129 --> 01:15:12,597
How old's your kid? You never told me.

930
01:15:28,114 --> 01:15:32,450
When my wife and I used to argue,
she'd get pretty worked up at me.

931
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,820
And I'm so stubborn.

932
01:15:37,223 --> 01:15:40,133
She'd get so frustrated, and she'd...

933
01:15:40,193 --> 01:15:41,901
she'd lose her temper with me.

934
01:15:41,961 --> 01:15:46,172
And she'd say, "Stupe,
you're such a fucking asshole."

935
01:15:46,232 --> 01:15:48,166
I can be.

936
01:15:50,603 --> 01:15:53,738
But almost immediately, she'd come over.

937
01:15:56,175 --> 01:15:58,084
And she'd put her hands on my face.

938
01:15:58,144 --> 01:16:00,678
And she'd say, "But you're <i>my</i> asshole."

939
01:16:03,983 --> 01:16:06,050
We were so in love.

940
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:11,122
And my son...

941
01:16:14,694 --> 01:16:19,964
My son was so beautiful, so smart.

942
01:16:23,202 --> 01:16:25,837
I wish you could have seen him.

943
01:16:29,942 --> 01:16:31,843
They're dead.

944
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:38,049
They were killed in
the World Trade Center attacks.

945
01:16:45,157 --> 01:16:47,867
And I was so angry.

946
01:16:47,927 --> 01:16:49,969
I was so full of hate.

947
01:16:50,029 --> 01:16:52,497
I just wanted someone to pay.

948
01:16:54,967 --> 01:16:57,602
So I enlisted in the Marine Corps.

949
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:05,985
About a year and a half later,
they shipped me over to Iraq,

950
01:17:06,045 --> 01:17:08,546
and I got my chance to fight.

951
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:13,659
I thought it would make me feel better,

952
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:16,488
but it just made me feel worse.

953
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:21,593
I did a lot of things I'm not real proud of.

954
01:17:24,263 --> 01:17:26,188
So, uh...

955
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:30,969
I became a hospital corpsman.

956
01:17:32,872 --> 01:17:36,649
'Cause I thought
if I saved lives, that would...

957
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:41,613
that would make me feel better, but I just...

958
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:45,683
I lost more men than I saved.

959
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,921
And one day...

960
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:55,001
...after months of nightmares

961
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:59,605
and not being able to keep
my goddamn hands from shaking,

962
01:17:59,665 --> 01:18:01,699
I just stopped.

963
01:18:05,037 --> 01:18:07,138
I just...

964
01:18:08,741 --> 01:18:13,111
I couldn't bear to watch
one more fucking person die.

965
01:18:18,317 --> 01:18:21,961
So they sent me home on a medical discharge,

966
01:18:22,021 --> 01:18:25,256
and I just turned myself off.

967
01:18:26,726 --> 01:18:30,862
For years, I just wanted to be invisible.

968
01:18:34,367 --> 01:18:38,778
And here I am again,
right in the middle of it,

969
01:18:38,838 --> 01:18:42,248
right in the middle of all this
fucking death and killing.

970
01:18:42,308 --> 01:18:46,018
It's like it's being shoved
down my fucking throat,

971
01:18:46,078 --> 01:18:47,653
and it just goes on and on.

972
01:18:47,713 --> 01:18:51,783
It just never stops,
and it's fucking for what?

973
01:18:53,786 --> 01:18:55,261
For what?

974
01:19:03,162 --> 01:19:07,899
When my family died, I died with them.

975
01:19:11,971 --> 01:19:15,081
But we're gonna get out of here.
We're gonna get Belinda.

976
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:17,275
We're gonna get the fuck out of here.

977
01:19:23,282 --> 01:19:25,316
Thank you for telling me.

978
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:29,228
I'm sorry I lied to you.

979
01:19:29,288 --> 01:19:32,624
I've just never really
been able to talk about it.

980
01:19:34,393 --> 01:19:37,395
Why'd you tell me you had to go to Hoboken?

981
01:19:43,402 --> 01:19:46,779
I thought if I told you
I was going to Hoboken,

982
01:19:46,839 --> 01:19:49,315
no fucking way you'd try to follow me.

983
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:54,245
Who the fuck wants to go to Hoboken?

984
01:19:56,215 --> 01:19:57,650
You.

985
01:20:01,053 --> 01:20:03,354
I got to take a piss.

986
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:24,108
Stupe!

987
01:20:29,949 --> 01:20:33,192
- What the fuck did you do?
- I'm so sorry.

988
01:20:33,252 --> 01:20:35,795
He came at me, and I...

989
01:20:41,427 --> 01:20:43,961
Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!

990
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:48,175
Oh, my God.

991
01:20:50,469 --> 01:20:51,911
Oh, my God.

992
01:20:51,971 --> 01:20:53,871
Stupe.

993
01:20:54,507 --> 01:20:57,016
Stupe. Stupe.

994
01:20:57,076 --> 01:20:59,351
Wake up. Wake up.

995
01:20:59,411 --> 01:21:01,420
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no.

996
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,322
Fuck.

997
01:21:03,382 --> 01:21:05,124
I don't know... I don't know what to do.

998
01:21:05,184 --> 01:21:06,225
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

999
01:21:06,285 --> 01:21:08,727
I'll just... Let me help you.

1000
01:21:08,987 --> 01:21:11,756
Let me... I don't...

1001
01:21:12,992 --> 01:21:14,959
Damn it.

1002
01:21:25,004 --> 01:21:28,247
I'm so sorry.

1003
01:21:28,307 --> 01:21:30,842
What am I gonna do?

1004
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,158
Fuck.

1005
01:21:39,218 --> 01:21:40,785
Sorry.

1006
01:22:17,056 --> 01:22:18,497
Lucy!

1007
01:22:18,557 --> 01:22:21,066
Lucy. Oh, yes!

1008
01:22:21,126 --> 01:22:24,036
Ohh. I thought I lost you, too.

1009
01:22:24,096 --> 01:22:25,838
Are you okay? What happened?

1010
01:22:25,898 --> 01:22:27,072
Did they do... Hey, hey.

1011
01:22:27,132 --> 01:22:28,941
Get the fuck away from my sister.

1012
01:22:29,001 --> 01:22:30,576
We did exactly what you asked.
Now get the fuck away from...

1013
01:22:30,636 --> 01:22:33,145
Hey, hey. Calm the fuck down.
The fight's outside.

1014
01:22:33,205 --> 01:22:35,881
You did your thing with the church group,
and we got your sister here.

1015
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:38,217
- You okay?
- Lucy, I'm really okay.

1016
01:22:38,277 --> 01:22:39,919
It's really bad outside.

1017
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:40,986
We all just want to get out of here.

1018
01:22:41,046 --> 01:22:42,488
Where's the big guy?

1019
01:22:42,548 --> 01:22:43,956
Look. You guys can stand
around talking about nothing,

1020
01:22:44,016 --> 01:22:45,124
but we're getting the fuck out of here.

1021
01:22:45,184 --> 01:22:46,492
- Just give me a minute.
- Wait.

1022
01:22:46,552 --> 01:22:47,893
You're wasting time. We're leaving.

1023
01:22:47,953 --> 01:22:49,495
Come on!

1024
01:22:49,555 --> 01:22:52,990
Lucy, what are you doing?

1025
01:22:56,328 --> 01:22:59,171
Fuck me.

1026
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:02,099
Really? He's dead?

1027
01:23:05,004 --> 01:23:06,979
That's some shit.

1028
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:08,848
We got to get out of here.

1029
01:23:15,047 --> 01:23:16,614
Whoa.

1030
01:23:17,983 --> 01:23:19,350
We're going.

1031
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,855
- Come on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1032
01:23:27,259 --> 01:23:29,068
Stay close to me.

1033
01:23:33,465 --> 01:23:35,207
I'm so scared.

1034
01:23:35,267 --> 01:23:37,209
I told you it was fucked up out here.

1035
01:23:37,269 --> 01:23:38,477
Stay close to me.

1036
01:23:38,537 --> 01:23:40,204
Okay, okay, okay. I'm here.

1037
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,344
There's so many people.
You can't even see anything.

1038
01:23:49,214 --> 01:23:51,249
Let's get behind this.

1039
01:23:52,685 --> 01:23:54,193
We're stuck.

1040
01:23:54,253 --> 01:23:55,294
We're not going to be able to get through.

1041
01:23:55,354 --> 01:23:57,129
- No, no, no.
- Lucy, let's go.

1042
01:23:57,189 --> 01:23:58,564
They have a plan. We just have
to get to those helicopters.

1043
01:23:58,624 --> 01:24:00,165
Where are they?

1044
01:24:00,225 --> 01:24:02,167
They're right over there.

1045
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:06,672
- Stay near me.
- Okay.

1046
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:17,608
Whoa!

1047
01:24:19,511 --> 01:24:21,186
Okay. Let's go.

1048
01:24:45,004 --> 01:24:46,671
Don't lose me.

1049
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:50,649
Oh, shit.

1050
01:24:55,047 --> 01:24:58,057
- Belinda, wait.
- Got you, bitch.

1051
01:24:58,117 --> 01:24:59,625
Get the fuck off me.

1052
01:25:02,221 --> 01:25:04,630
Come on. Come on. Get up. We got to move.

1053
01:25:07,659 --> 01:25:09,327
Belinda?

1054
01:25:14,466 --> 01:25:15,708
This way.

1055
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:19,645
Okay.

1056
01:25:19,705 --> 01:25:20,679
You're good. You're good. You're good.

1057
01:25:20,739 --> 01:25:22,514
Okay.

1058
01:25:22,574 --> 01:25:24,516
This way. This way. This way.

1059
01:25:24,576 --> 01:25:27,353
- The gun's out.
- Drop it, drop it.

1060
01:25:35,487 --> 01:25:37,730
Take his gun. Take his gun.

1061
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,190
Come on.

1062
01:25:42,227 --> 01:25:44,303
Help me. Help me. Help me.

1063
01:25:46,765 --> 01:25:48,840
Run and keep shooting!

1064
01:25:55,474 --> 01:25:57,783
Yeah? Okay.

1065
01:25:57,843 --> 01:25:59,685
Gonna get behind those barrels.

1066
01:25:59,745 --> 01:26:02,246
Ready? Okay. Run.

1067
01:26:03,082 --> 01:26:04,590
Run!

1068
01:26:09,588 --> 01:26:11,263
You okay?

1069
01:26:11,323 --> 01:26:12,598
We have to make it through there.

1070
01:26:12,658 --> 01:26:13,766
What?

1071
01:26:13,826 --> 01:26:16,135
No. Fuck. We're not gonna make it.

1072
01:26:16,195 --> 01:26:18,337
Okay. We're gonna pull these. Are you ready?

1073
01:26:18,397 --> 01:26:21,173
We're gonna pull these. One, two, three.

1074
01:26:21,233 --> 01:26:22,808
- Throw it.
- Throw.

1075
01:26:22,868 --> 01:26:25,110
Grenade! Grenade! Grenade!

1076
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,822
- Oh, look!
- We found it.

1077
01:26:36,882 --> 01:26:38,757
We're almost in. The helicopters
are right over there.

1078
01:26:38,817 --> 01:26:40,092
We got to get the fuck out of here.

1079
01:26:40,152 --> 01:26:41,160
Oh, shit.

1080
01:26:46,391 --> 01:26:48,167
I see the helicopter.

1081
01:26:49,628 --> 01:26:51,637
Come on. We're so close.

1082
01:26:54,766 --> 01:26:57,543
Everybody keep moving towards the chopper.

1083
01:26:57,603 --> 01:26:59,144
Aah!

1084
01:26:59,204 --> 01:27:00,512
Aah!

1085
01:27:00,572 --> 01:27:01,713
Stay low.

1086
01:27:05,711 --> 01:27:07,611
Belinda!

1087
01:27:09,281 --> 01:27:12,191
Okay. I'm coming for you.

1088
01:27:12,251 --> 01:27:14,293
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1089
01:27:14,353 --> 01:27:16,862
Aah! Aah!

1090
01:27:16,922 --> 01:27:19,131
Aah!

1091
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:21,133
Oh. Fuck.

1092
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:31,143
Fuck. Okay. Can you walk?

1093
01:27:31,203 --> 01:27:32,344
I can't.

1094
01:27:32,404 --> 01:27:33,879
Okay, okay. I'm gonna pull you.

1095
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:35,347
- Okay?
- Okay.

1096
01:27:35,407 --> 01:27:36,707
Okay. One.

1097
01:27:38,277 --> 01:27:40,552
We're so close. We're so close.

1098
01:27:40,612 --> 01:27:42,388
Lucy!

1099
01:27:43,545 --> 01:27:45,858
Lucy, get up.

1100
01:27:45,918 --> 01:27:47,292
Lucy.

1101
01:28:08,307 --> 01:28:10,449
Come on.

1102
01:28:10,509 --> 01:28:12,918
No!

1103
01:28:12,978 --> 01:28:14,386
Come on, come on.

1104
01:28:14,446 --> 01:28:16,622
- Get up.
- I won't leave her.

1105
01:28:16,682 --> 01:28:18,223
We got to keep moving.

1106
01:28:18,283 --> 01:28:20,026
No!

1107
01:28:22,654 --> 01:28:24,663
