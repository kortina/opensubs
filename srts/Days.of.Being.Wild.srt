00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,478
What's your name?

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,032
Why should l tell you?

Who told you?

10
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,397
You'll see me tonight
in your dreams.

11
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,271
l didn't see you
in my dreams last night.

12
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,991
Of course not.
You didn't even get any sleep.

13
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,753
Don't fight it.
You'll see me for sure.

14
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,078
There's something different
about you today.

15
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,998
No, there's nothing different.

16
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,916
No?

17
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,794
Why are your ears red?

18
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,597
What do you want?

19
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,511
l just want to be friends with you.

20
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,476
Why should l be your friend?

21
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,118
Look at my watch.

22
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,037
Why should l?

23
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,958
Just for a minute, okay?

24
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,111
Time's up. What now?

25
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,038
What's today's date?

26
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,912
The 16th.

27
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,838
The 16th.

28
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,757
April 16th.

29
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,591
April 16th, 1960,
one minute before 3:00.

30
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,510
We were here together.

31
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,357
l'll always remember
that minute because of you.

32
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,237
From now on,
we're one-minute friends.

33
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,078
lt's a fact.
You can't deny it.

34
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,958
lt's already happened.

35
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,718
l'll be back tomorrow.

36
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,320
<Would he remember
<that minute because of me?

37
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,230
<l don't know.

38
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,078
<But l remembered him.

39
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,958
<He came back every day after that.

40
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,832
<We started as one-minute friends,

41
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,752
<then two minutes...

42
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,593
<Soon we were spending
<an hour a day together.

43
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,718
How long have we known each other?

44
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,598
A long time.

45
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,512
l've forgotten.

46
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,120
My cousin's getting married soon.

47
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,997
Really? Give her my best wishes.

48
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,758
She said

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,639
she'll be moving in
with her husband's family.

50
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,550
So?

51
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,311
l have to find someplace else to live.

52
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,637
l'd like to live with you.

53
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,232
Sure.

54
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,872
How will l tell my dad?

55
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,796
Tell him what?

56
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,672
About us.

57
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,636
What about us?

58
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,997
Would you marry me?

59
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,478
No.

60
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,157
l'm never coming back.

61
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,476
Come in, quick.

62
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,351
Your mother drank too much
and threw up all over.

63
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,239
l'm so worried about her.

64
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,150
Bring her some tea.

65
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,829
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?

66
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,750
Who's that guy?

67
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,638
lt was just a pair of earrings!

68
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,558
Here, take 'em back!

69
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,116
You stole more than that.

70
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,955
l told you l never stole anything!
She gave them to me willingly!

71
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,713
You mean she's willing
to let you freeload off her!

72
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,433
- Let's see what you say now.
- Don't hit me!

73
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,240
- Huh?
- Stop hitting me!

74
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,038
What's that? Speak up!

75
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,950
- Louder!
- l stole 'em!

76
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,878
Louder!

77
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,836
l stole 'em!

78
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,639
l'm warning you: Don't let me
catch you around my mother again!

79
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,872
You can get changed now.

80
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,117
l left some earrings here.
Have you seen them?

81
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,953
No, but l'll help you look.

82
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,711
Hey, what are you doing?

83
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,077
You like this earring?

84
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,952
Keep it.

85
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,510
Hey!

86
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,277
Why just one?

87
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,192
l'll wait for you downstairs.

88
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,637
Where are we?

89
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,590
My place.

90
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,471
When did l say
l'd come home with you?

91
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,392
You never said you wouldn't.

92
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,672
You live alone?

93
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,432
ls the rent high?

94
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,350
Forty bucks.

95
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,310
Wow.

96
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,109
My whole family lives in one room
that only costs $28.

97
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,793
You bring girls home often?

98
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,636
Sometimes.

99
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,228
Let's get something clear.
l'll stay, but just for a little while.

100
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,871
lt's stuffy in here.

101
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,679
Are there other tenants here?

102
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,272
Why's this room empty?

103
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,119
You like nosing around
other people's places.

104
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,956
Where's the bathroom?

105
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,477
Let's go get something to eat.

106
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,398
Why didn't you say so earlier?

107
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,118
lt's pouring outside.

108
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,076
l'd better go now.

109
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,990
Would you take me home?

110
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,595
- Why did you come with me then?
- l just promised to stay a while.

111
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,511
What kind of girl do you think l am?

112
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,397
Don't think l just jump
into bed with guys!

113
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,279
Don't think l'll do just anything
for some cheap earrings!

114
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,114
l'm not like those other loose women!

115
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,032
Don't come near me!

116
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,558
Let's see how long
you can go without breathing.

117
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,030
- A thief!
- Who's that?

118
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,950
- lt's me.
- My friend.

119
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,631
l've told you many times
not to climb up here.

120
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,439
l don't want that lndian guard
downstairs to hassle me.

121
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,038
l didn't know you had a friend here.
l'll be going.

122
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,919
Take the stairs.

123
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,832
ln the window,
out the window.

124
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,673
How come your friend's so strange?
What's he do?

125
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,552
Don't ask so many questions.

126
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,997
ls he a thief?

127
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,277
What time is it?

128
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,030
About 3:00.

129
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,798
l've gotta go home now.

130
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,751
Will we see each other tomorrow?

131
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,672
Maybe.

132
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,511
Then call me.

133
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,352
You have my phone number?

134
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,071
l'll write it down.

135
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,315
Call after 11 :00
or l won't be there.

136
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,158
Here.

137
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,909
Leung Fung-Ying?
Aren't you called Lulu?

138
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,797
My coworkers don't know
my English name.

139
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,631
Call me. You promised, okay?

140
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,518
Okay.

141
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,877
l know you won't call.

142
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,798
l will.

143
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,553
You didn't even memorize my number!

144
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,472
You wrote it down.
Why should l memorize it?

145
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,398
What if it gets lost?

146
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,153
l could get lost just as easily.

147
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,120
Don't you dare lose it!

148
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,953
Do it and l'll pour
acid on your face!

149
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,717
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

150
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,880
You're good.

151
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,757
You tamed me.
l have to do as you say.

152
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,557
Aren't you going home?

153
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,472
l'll call you a cab.

154
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,951
Now l don't want to go home.

155
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,592
Stay here then.

156
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,390
Damn you!

157
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,998
Good morning.

158
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,796
You still here?
Don't you have to go home?

159
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,712
You didn't go home yourself.

160
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,558
l'm not talking to you.

161
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,470
Hey.

162
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,392
Have we ever met?

163
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,271
You don't look familiar.

164
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,076
But you'd be the one to know
if you've noticed me somewhere.

165
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,913
- What do you do for work?
- Work?

166
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,679
Turn up the radio.

167
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,753
Any idea? Figure it out?

168
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,678
Not yet.

169
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,640
Dance for me again, okay?

170
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,517
You trying to take advantage?

171
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,313
Hey! What's your name?

172
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,232
Call me Mimi.

173
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,793
<l've heard
<there's a kind of bird with no legs.

174
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,672
<All it can do is fly and fly.

175
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,554
<When it gets tired,
<it sleeps on the wind.

176
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,398
<This bird can only land once
<in its whole life.

177
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,231
<That's the moment it dies.

178
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,516
Auntie.

179
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,397
Come here.
l want to talk to you.

180
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,917
Move over.

181
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,719
Hey, who is she?

182
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,632
What was all that about?

183
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
What?

184
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,433
You know what l'm talking about.
Why did you beat him up?

185
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,360
He was ripping you off.

186
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,237
Who told you that?

187
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,117
No one has to tell me.

188
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,031
Why else would he be with you?

189
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,838
How old is he?
And how old are you?

190
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,790
You're not young anymore.

191
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,599
You're right.
He's in it for the money.

192
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,550
But he makes me happy.

193
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,393
l raised you and spent lots on you,
but have you ever made me happy?

194
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,233
You think l've been happy?
So we'll be unhappy together.

195
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,078
- What do you want?
- You know very well.

196
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,749
How many times do l
have to say l won't tell you?

197
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,637
You want to find
your real mother, right?

198
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,596
Find her yourself, if you can.

199
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,437
l've taken care of you
for so many years.

200
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,311
lf l was gonna tell you,
l'd have done it long ago.

201
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,113
l didn't because l couldn't bear
to see you leave.

202
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,955
And l won't tell you now either.
What's in it for me?

203
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,916
Suppose l tell you.

204
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,797
What do l get
if you go off and find her?

205
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,712
Nothing!

206
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,630
You'll forget all about me.

207
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,476
What?

208
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,392
Why are you staring at me like that?

209
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,153
Fine. l want you to hate me.

210
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,078
At least that way
you won't forget me.

211
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,717
Come on, be nicer to me.

212
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,558
Maybe l'll tell you someday.

213
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,470
Otherwise, forget about it.

214
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,356
All right.

215
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,199
l'll be waiting for that day.

216
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,991
ls his mother rich?

217
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,798
l think so.

218
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,671
She was a high-class escort.

219
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,560
Have you known York for long?

220
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,190
He used to live
in the apartment above our garage.

221
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,994
You know what's on his mind?

222
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,878
No, l don't.

223
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,674
But l know what's on your mind.

224
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,592
What?

225
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,398
Don't fall in love with me!

226
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,678
What are you doing here this late?

227
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,552
Waiting for my friend.

228
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,276
What is it?

229
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,158
A girl downstairs
says she knows you.

230
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,071
You'd better go have a look.

231
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,918
l'm gonna go see.

232
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,350
Why have you come?

233
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,997
To get my things.

234
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,910
Come up then.

235
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,560
l'd like to come back to you.

236
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,470
What for?

237
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,318
l'm no good for you.

238
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,037
l'm not the marrying type.

239
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,158
l don't care.

240
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,032
l just want to stay with you.

241
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,517
Why do you put up
with so much from me?

242
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,353
You can't just put up with me
for the rest your life.

243
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,037
You won't be happy with me.

244
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,512
Did you ever really love me?

245
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,159
l can't know how many more women
l'll fall for in my life.

246
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,958
l won't know which l love most
till the end of my life.

247
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,430
Wait here.

248
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,317
l'll collect your things for you.

249
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,118
ls someone up there?

250
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,276
Who's outside?

251
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,190
Stop asking questions.

252
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,911
- Take off those slippers.
- Why?

253
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,792
They belong to someone else.

254
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,639
Who says they're hers?
You got any proof?

255
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,517
You gonna take them off?

256
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,476
No!

257
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,360
A woman shows up out of the blue
claiming this is hers and that's hers.

258
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,191
How many more women
will show up later?

259
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,080
lf one comes and claims you,
should l just give you up?

260
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,990
l'm not giving up anything!

261
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,879
Once l step in here,
everything is mine!

262
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,433
Why did you come up?
l told you to wait downstairs.

263
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,310
l'm leaving.

264
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,712
You can sleep
with the slippers tonight.

265
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,513
You really care about the slippers?
Okay, l'll give 'em back!

266
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,318
Satisfied now?

267
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,231
After all, nothing here is mine.

268
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,113
What am l to you anyway?
l'm leaving.

269
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,359
Don't come back
once you step out that door.

270
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,751
Do you treat all women like this?

271
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,717
l'm not gonna be as stupid as her.

272
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,871
What are you doing?

273
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,759
Why do you treat me like this?

274
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,597
Stop! You're hurting me!

275
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,356
You again?

276
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,236
Still haven't gone home?

277
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,909
A good night's sleep
and you'll forget your problems.

278
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,273
Could you lend me
a few dollars for a cab?

279
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,319
l've only got five.
ls that enough?

280
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,190
How will l pay you back?

281
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,072
Don't worry about it.

282
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,960
l'm always on duty around here.

283
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,870
We may meet again.

284
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,790
Take it.

285
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,310
Oh, it's you.

286
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,197
l wanted to pay you back.

287
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,038
No hurry.
lt doesn't matter.

288
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,956
l don't want to owe you.

289
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,796
Thanks.

290
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,672
Are you all right?

291
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,519
l'll be going now.
l have to go to work.

292
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,398
This late? What kind of work?

293
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,316
At the stadium.

294
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,158
There's a game tonight.
l have to work the box office.

295
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,915
Then l can get in
to a soccer game for free.

296
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,753
l used to like watching soccer,
but l'm too busy these days.

297
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,513
lf there's a game you want to see,
don't buy a ticket.

298
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,392
l'll get you in.

299
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,278
Thanks.

300
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,951
Could we talk?

301
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,799
l can't help you
with your boyfriend.

302
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,630
l just want to talk.

303
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,552
Don't you have any friends?

304
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,399
- l don't want others to know.
- But you'll tell me?

305
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,158
lf l don't...

306
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,834
lf l don't get it off my chest,
l'll go crazy.

307
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,477
l thought l would be okay.

308
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,197
l kept telling myself,

309
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,077
""Don't tell others you're unhappy.

310
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,958
Work harder.

311
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,832
Go home and get to bed early.""

312
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,432
l want to go home,

313
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,312
but my home is in Macao.

314
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,953
l don't know how to get through
these long nights.

315
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,797
l can't sleep.

316
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,399
l don't mean
to keep coming back.

317
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,238
l promise myself,
""l won't go back.

318
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,993
l'll hate myself if l go back again.""

319
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,872
l don't want to hate myself.

320
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,598
Help me, please.

321
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,512
You can't go on like this.

322
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,354
l'll be okay if l can just
get through tonight.

323
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,794
You always say,
""l'll be okay after tonight.""

324
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,718
What about last night?

325
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,513
lf you'd made it through last night,
you wouldn't be here now.

326
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,229
Make up your mind.
Stop going back and forth.

327
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,112
lf you really can't live without him,

328
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,959
why don't you go right up
and tell him?

329
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,749
Otherwise, starting this very minute,
pretend you don't know the guy.

330
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,716
Don't mention ""this very minute!""

331
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,159
l used to think a minute
could pass so quickly.

332
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,997
But actually, it can take forever.

333
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,597
One day a guy pointed
at his watch and told me

334
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,399
he'd remember me forever
because of that minute.

335
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,232
That sounded so sweet.

336
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,592
But now when l look at that clock,

337
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,478
l tell myself

338
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,235
l have to forget that guy
starting this very minute.

339
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,598
As a little girl in Macao,
l really wanted to ride the streetcar.

340
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,274
Whenever my cousin returned
from Hong Kong,

341
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,153
l'd ask her when she was going
to take me there.

342
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,952
Your cousin is from Hong Kong?

343
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,789
No, but she studied in Hong Kong
when she was young.

344
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,676
She's really sharp.

345
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,469
She got a good job with a foreign company
right after graduation.

346
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,318
Her boyfriend is successful too.

347
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,198
She's going to get married soon.

348
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,958
Not everyone can be that lucky.

349
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,718
Don't compare yourself
with other people.

350
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,472
l didn't feel poor

351
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,317
until l started school.

352
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,153
All the other guys got
new uniforms every year,

353
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,957
but l had to wear
the same one every year.

354
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,792
That's when...

355
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,676
l realized l was poor.

356
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,277
What made you become a policeman?

357
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,990
l wanted to be a sailor,

358
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,793
but my mother's health
wasn't very good,

359
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,678
and there was no one else at home.

360
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,592
So l had to stay.

361
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,113
Don't you find it boring
walking around by yourself all night?

362
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,870
Not really.

363
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,952
l'm tired.
l think l'll go home now.

364
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,876
Okay.

365
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,675
lf you can't find anyone to talk to,
come see me.

366
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,513
l wouldn't want to interfere
with your work.

367
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,317
You can call me then.

368
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,153
l'm here about this time every day.

369
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,838
You have enough money for the fare?

370
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,714
Yes. Bye.

371
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,109
<l never really thought she'd call.

372
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,876
<But every time l passed by the phone booth,
<l'd stand there for a while.

373
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,635
<Maybe she's all right
<and she made it back to Macao.

374
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,312
<Or maybe she just needed someone
<to help her through that one night.

375
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,158
<Soon after that,
<my mother passed away,

376
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,992
<and l became a sailor.

377
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,433
Son, come eat your meal.

378
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,396
lt's ready now.

379
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,277
Ranjet, come and eat.

380
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,069
You want me to beat you?

381
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,837
<My heart is broken

382
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,756
Do l look pretty?

383
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,149
- Did you scrub the floor?
- Yes. lt just dried really fast.

384
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,078
lf you don't believe me.
l'll swear to it!

385
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,992
Swear on your mother's grave.

386
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,839
Why?
So what if l didn't scrub it?

387
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,757
Why should l swear on her grave?

388
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,637
l'll scrub it when l come back, okay?

389
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,196
All right, l'll scrub it
before l go out.

390
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,997
Could you stop being so quiet?

391
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,358
You seem so depressed.

392
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,191
l'll treat you to a movie, okay?

393
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,716
lf you don't have any money,
l still have a few bucks.

394
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,517
Are you broke?

395
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,357
Maybe l could support you.

396
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,198
My girlfriend's got a new job
at the Oriental Nightclub.

397
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,034
She says it's easy
earning a living as a dance hostess.

398
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,958
l wouldn't mind,

399
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,839
but you'd have to pick me up
every night after work.

400
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,751
- Then l'd be your ""boy.""
- Do you care?

401
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,631
The important thing is to be happy.

402
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,557
l wouldn't tell anybody.

403
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,197
Still want to go to a movie?

404
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,150
Let's go.

405
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,033
Okay, but l want
to fix my hair first.

406
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,836
You don't have to change?

407
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,710
Wait, my slippers -

408
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,478
l had breakfast
with Old Man this morning.

409
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,351
He realized l was in a bad mood.

410
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,277
He asked me to go
to the States with him.

411
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,077
l know very well

412
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,998
that at my age

413
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,749
it's hard to find
someone you really like.

414
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,594
The Old Man treats me so well.

415
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,512
So that's that.

416
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,233
He's quite old,
but he's kindhearted.

417
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,152
What do you think?

418
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,874
l won't be coming back.

419
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,713
lf you want,
you can come along.

420
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,593
l won't force you
if you don't want to.

421
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,473
Of course you won't force me.

422
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,392
You're the one who wants to leave.

423
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,276
Stop dreaming.

424
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,111
You force me to stay
with you all these years,

425
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,032
and now suddenly you're leaving.

426
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,872
l won't let you go.

427
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,757
l've taken care of you
for so many years.

428
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,678
l won't abandon you now.

429
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,550
l've arranged everything for you.

430
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,476
l'll leave you the house.

431
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,311
l'll send you money every month.

432
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,080
l don't want anything.

433
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,957
l just want you to stay.

434
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,793
You always wanted
to keep me with you,

435
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,593
so there's no way
l'll let you go now either.

436
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,393
- lf you dare to try -
- Are you threatening me?

437
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,238
All right.
l don't really want to go anyway.

438
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,112
l'll be old in a few years.

439
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,997
You gonna take care of me?

440
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,918
With what?

441
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,870
Doesn't matter.

442
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,718
lf l can't, we'll just starve
to death together.

443
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,592
That's your dream anyway, isn't it?

444
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,477
You're really something, you know?

445
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,269
You've fought me all these years.

446
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,198
Can't you be a little nicer to me?

447
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,991
ln that case, you shouldn't have
let me know l was adopted.

448
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,799
Then everything would've been fine.

449
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,633
But you told me a little
and hid the rest.

450
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,393
l just want to know
who my parents are.

451
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,271
But you won't tell me.

452
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,117
Don't you know you're giving me
an excuse to hate you?

453
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,040
Fine! Go find out yourself then!

454
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,871
The Philippines isn't that big.
Go and look!

455
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,796
You just don't dare!

456
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,717
You're afraid you'll find out
your mother isn't rich

457
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,599
or from a famous family.
Maybe worse than me!

458
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,312
That's none of your business.

459
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,158
l'll keep pushing until you tell me.

460
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,037
We can keep playing
this game forever.

461
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,835
You'll have to tell me
the truth one of these days.

462
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,711
l won't be as happy
to hear it from others.

463
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,597
lt has to be you.

464
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,476
Unless maybe you die first.

465
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,357
Then it'll cease to matter.

466
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,673
l should never have said anything.

467
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,512
l told you

468
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,392
because you're not my own blood,

469
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,277
and l know sooner or later
you'll leave me.

470
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,993
l always thought l'd be all right.

471
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,758
l never realized
l couldn't bear to see you leave.

472
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,311
So l just never told you.

473
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,117
That was selfish of me.

474
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,875
But l meant well.
l wanted to protect you.

475
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,677
They didn't want you at all.

476
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,560
lf they really wanted you,

477
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,437
they'd have come for you long ago.

478
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,316
You wouldn't understand.

479
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,035
l know you won't listen
to anything l say now.

480
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,799
You've run wild all these years.

481
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,473
Now you want to blame me
and have your revenge.

482
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,358
Fine.

483
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,231
l'll tell you who your mother is now.

484
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,156
l've had it with you.

485
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,789
You've always used it
as an excuse before.

486
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,511
Well, you can't use it any longer.

487
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,432
You want to fly off?

488
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,360
All right, fly.

489
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,237
Fly as far as you can.

490
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,994
But don't let me find out
you got cold feet.

491
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,832
Made up your mind?

492
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,632
l've said it many times,

493
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,471
but now it's time to actually go.

494
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,312
That's good.

495
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,157
How long will you be gone?

496
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,957
l don't know what will happen there...

497
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,751
or when l'll be back.

498
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,437
Take care of yourself.

499
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,112
Does she know you're leaving?

500
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,919
l have to leave,
whether she knows or not.

501
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,753
lf she comes around bothering you,
tell her l'm gone.

502
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,470
Take these.

503
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,957
l know you've always liked it.

504
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,792
Take good care of it.

505
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,718
Has he been here?

506
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,279
l asked you if he's been here!

507
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,113
Stop ignoring me!

508
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,031
l know you're seeing him!

509
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,873
Have you no self-respect?
He already said he doesn't want you!

510
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,751
- Why can't you leave him alone?
- Are you done?

511
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,672
He's left you now too,
so go home and cry!

512
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,557
Why come tell me about it?

513
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,318
Okay, he treated me badly,
but did he treat you any better?

514
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,237
Don't touch me!

515
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,151
He treats all women the same!

516
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,515
You can stay a little while,
but l'm locking up soon.

517
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,191
l shouldn't really have come.

518
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,118
l shouldn't give you
a chance to gloat.

519
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,917
Still, l thinks he likes me
a little more.

520
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,718
For whatever reason,
he left you for me.

521
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,439
lt's better to find some things out
sooner than later.

522
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,319
You're the one crying now.

523
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,232
l got over it a long time ago.

524
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,436
What is it?

525
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,151
- Has your son come by?
- No.

526
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,955
Then would you know
where l could find him?

527
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,838
No, he never tells me anything.

528
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,509
lf you ever see him,

529
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,355
tell him Mimi's looking for him.

530
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,271
He has my phone number.

531
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,994
l don't know if l'll see him.

532
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,912
l'm leaving tomorrow.

533
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,797
ls he going with you?

534
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,317
May l take a look at your place?

535
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,349
He used to always ask me
to wait downstairs.

536
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,232
l really wanted to know

537
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,111
what this place looked like.

538
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,872
lt's like every other place.

539
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,552
Am l being foolish?

540
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,395
No, l was just like you
when l was young.

541
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,231
You want me to call you a cab?

542
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,196
No, thanks.

543
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,830
Oh, it's you.

544
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,750
l thought it was York.

545
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,232
He left for the Philippines.

546
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,232
Why are you following me?

547
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,840
Stop following me!
Go away!

548
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,717
l don't ever want to see you again!

549
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,600
Why send me away?
Why can't l follow you?

550
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,433
- l don't want anything to happen to you!
- Stop being so good to me!

551
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,357
l told you before
not to fall in love with me!

552
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,280
What's going on?
You taking over?

553
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,113
You got his car and his girlfriend -
but do you deserve them?

554
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,031
Just 'cause he's gone
doesn't mean l have to love you!

555
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,951
l won't fall in love with you!

556
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,872
What are you doing?

557
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,759
Let me go!

558
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,637
What do you want?

559
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,237
l really want
to go to the Philippines.

560
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,196
l really do.

561
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,432
Here.

562
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,992
What's with all this money?

563
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,470
Like you said,
you have to deserve something.

564
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,193
He looked real good in the car.

565
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,993
l looked like a joke.

566
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,754
So it was better just to sell it.

567
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,989
Go to the Philippines
if you really want to.

568
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,711
And when you see York,
tell him l'm sorry.

569
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,597
Tell him l couldn't handle the car,
so l sold it.

570
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,797
And if you really can't find York...

571
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,078
then come back to me.

572
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,588
<On April 12, 1961,
<l finally arrived at my mother's house.

573
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,477
<But she didn't want to see me.

574
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,357
<The maids told me
<she no longer lived there.

575
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,071
<As l was leaving,

576
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,959
<l could feel a pair of eyes
<watching me from behind,

577
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,794
<but l was determined
<not to turn around.

578
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,475
<l just wanted to find out
<what she looked like.

579
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,320
<Since she wouldn't give me
<that chance,

580
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,153
<l wouldn't give it to her either.

581
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,840
- You have a room?
- Thirty dollars a day.

582
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,638
Five for an extra bed.
How long are you staying?

583
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,552
Two days.
l'm waiting for a ship.

584
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,276
Thanks.

585
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,076
<Who's there?

586
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,833
Are you alone, mister?

587
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,670
You done now?

588
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,272
What?

589
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,637
lt's stuck.

590
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,193
Hey, you gonna fall asleep
on me right here?

591
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,110
Easy!

592
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,919
You gonna sleep here?

593
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,799
A lot of people walk by here.

594
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,710
Hey!

595
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,516
Are you serious?

596
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,159
You're really gonna
fall asleep on me.

597
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,031
Well, it's up to you.

598
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,477
You haven't gone out?

599
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,352
l just came back.

600
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,077
ls someone with you?

601
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,912
Just a friend.

602
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,397
Am l in the way?

603
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,310
No.

604
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,910
She's not bad.

605
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,472
You ever stayed here before?

606
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,352
You know how small Chinatown is.

607
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,199
Lots of people come and stay here.

608
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,116
Almost everyone
ends up staying here.

609
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,957
Did you come from Hong Kong?

610
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:57,916
Yeah.

611
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,752
What do you do?

612
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,678
l'm a sailor.

613
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,512
How long?

614
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,358
l just changed jobs.

615
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,276
l used to be a cop before.

616
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,118
Not bad.

617
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,954
Why'd you switch from cop to sailor?

618
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,675
Oh... just wanted to wander around.

619
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,592
Anyway...

620
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,472
how long have you been
in the Philippines?

621
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,390
A few months.

622
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,117
What for? You working?

623
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,998
l hate work.

624
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,757
l'm looking for my family.

625
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,632
Did you find them?

626
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,518
Something like that.

627
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,273
Even my watch is gone.
What's the time?

628
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:07,958
3:30

629
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,718
Shall we go have a drink?

630
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,554
No, thanks. lt's late.

631
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:23,320
lf it's too late to go back to your place,
why not just stay here?

632
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:26,153
l have wine here.
Help yourself.

633
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,036
l don't have a place.

634
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,833
Anyway, l have to be
at the station at dawn.

635
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,717
That's just a few hours from now.

636
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,593
Better to drink the hours away
than sleep.

637
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,398
You heading somewhere else?

638
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,193
l get bored staying
in one place too long.

639
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,033
Like you said,
l like to wander around.

640
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:53,956
Want some?

641
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,717
Thanks.

642
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,591
When will you go back?

643
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,431
When they finish
unloading the cargo.

644
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,275
Probably take about two days.

645
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,153
How about you?
Are you going back?

646
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,072
Maybe.

647
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,913
Even if l wanted to,
it wouldn't be for a while.

648
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,639
Maybe we'll run into each other
in Hong Kong.

649
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,518
Might not even recognize each other.

650
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,357
l hope that doesn't happen.

651
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,831
Have l seen you somewhere before?

652
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,513
Don't remember.
My memory's not so good.

653
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,110
Mine neither.

654
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,755
Get out of here! Go!

655
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,510
Hey.

656
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,392
What train are you taking?

657
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,276
l didn't say l was.

658
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,991
lf you're not taking a train,

659
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:16,836
why'd you come to the station?

660
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,758
l'm meeting someone.

661
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,397
He and l have something to discuss.

662
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,155
l owe you this one.
lt's on me next time.

663
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:00,956
lt's an American passport.

664
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,793
That's a big deal!
Worth a lot of money.

665
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,677
l've killed a lot of people.

666
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,592
But that's part of my job,
you know.

667
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,471
Now, where is my money?

668
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,350
Money?

669
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,198
l don't have your money.

670
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,518
That was fast.

671
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,396
Stop him!

672
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,350
Run!

673
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,838
You ever been to the States?

674
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,592
Why aren't you talking?

675
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,472
Worried you'll miss your ship?

676
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,352
Not everyone's like you.

677
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,278
You don't have a care in the world,

678
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,198
but l have to earn a living.

679
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,878
lf you want a passport, pay for it!

680
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,757
lf you don't have money,
don't start trouble!

681
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,677
We could have died back there!

682
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,557
Back there?

683
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,433
You could die any minute.
This train could derail.

684
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,356
How can you predict it?

685
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,191
lf you're tired of living, fine.

686
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,118
But don't drag me down with you.

687
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,999
Hey, l told you
to take off back there,

688
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,912
but here you are tagging along.

689
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,791
l wish you had been killed,
you son of a bitch!

690
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,513
- You ever hear of a bird that -
- Yes.

691
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,397
The one with no legs.

692
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,274
Maybe you can fool girls
with that story.

693
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,192
Think you're some kind of bird?

694
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,110
Which part of you?

695
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,869
You're just the drunk l picked
out of the garbage in Chinatown!

696
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,757
Think you're a bird?

697
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,639
lf you could fly,
you wouldn't have to be here.

698
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,396
Go ahead, fly!

699
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,277
Show me how you fly.

700
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,150
You'll see.

701
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,913
Just don't be jealous when it happens.

702
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,518
Tell me,

703
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,397
how long till the next station?

704
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:01,235
l don't understand you.
Say again.

705
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,917
<That day when l left the hospital,

706
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,791
<l felt very relieved.

707
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,599
<My financial worries were over.

708
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,398
<l'd receive 50 American dollars
<every month

709
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,233
<until the child turned 18.

710
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,918
<l've always wanted to know what l'd see
<the last moment of my life.

711
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,633
So l mustn't close
my eyes when l die.

712
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,398
What about you?

713
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,199
What do you wanna see most
the moment your life ends?

714
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,918
Life is so long.

715
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,759
There's a lot l haven't seen yet.

716
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,638
l don't know.

717
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,519
l don't know what l want to see.

718
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,352
Give it some thought.

719
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,157
lt's gotta be boring at sea anyway.

720
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,992
Life isn't really that long.

721
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,791
Now's the time
to start thinking about it.

722
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,958
<l used to think
<there was some kind of bird

723
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,834
<that flew and flew,
<never touching down until it died.

724
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,717
<But that bird never
<actually flew anywhere,

725
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,558
<because it was dead
<from the very beginning.

726
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,391
<l said l'd never be able to tell

727
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,311
<which woman
<l loved the most until the end.

728
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,071
<l wonder what she's doing now.

729
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,878
<lt's dawn.

730
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,758
<Looks like quite a beautiful day.

731
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,599
<l wonder what sunset will be like.

732
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,392
<The last time l saw him,

733
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,237
<l asked him a question.

734
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:54,789
You remember what you were doing

735
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:56,717
on April 16th of last year
at 3:00 p.m.?

736
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,592
Why do you ask?

737
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,510
No reason.

738
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,353
A friend of mine
used to test my memory

739
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:09,189
and asked me what l did that day.

740
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,994
l couldn't remember.
What about you?

741
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,830
Did she tell you?

742
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,551
l thought you'd forgotten.

743
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,360
l remember what
should be remembered.

744
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,196
Did you see each other a lot?

745
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,998
For a time.

746
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,793
But once l changed jobs,
we lost touch.

747
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,516
What about you?

748
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,436
Me?

749
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,318
No.

750
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,151
What else did she tell you?

751
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,918
Nothing.

752
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,751
We really didn't know
each other that long.

753
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,552
Do you love her?

754
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,238
No, we're just friends.

755
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,954
When you see her again,
tell her l remember nothing.

756
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,791
lt's better that way for all of us.

757
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,553
l don't even know
if l'll ever see her again.

758
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,317
Even if l do...

759
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,112
she may not recognize me.

760
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,589
You've come here all by yourself.
Aren't you afraid?

761
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,399
l heard everyone
from Hong Kong stays here,

762
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,311
There's someone
l want to ask you about.
