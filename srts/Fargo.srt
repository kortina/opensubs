Am I, uh...

00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,327
What are we waiting for?

7
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,898
What?

8
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,934
The arrows.

9
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:10,004
Gayle's putting in the arrows
on Reagan.

10
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,105
Yeah, I know.

11
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,275
It's--
They said--

12
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:17,011
Jenny came by the trailer,
and she said five minutes, so--

13
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:18,779
Well, there's a lot of arrows.

14
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:24,384
So...

15
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,520
- Should I just go back to my--
- No.

16
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:28,889
No, it's, uh--
Jenny said--

17
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:30,357
What did Jenny say?

18
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,060
They're-- they're--
they're putting in the arrows.

19
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,061
Yeah, I know.

20
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,128
But how long?

21
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,630
Doll, just find out,
will you?

22
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:38,832
'Cause the Chief is wearing
moccasins here.

23
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:40,267
It's goddamn February.

24
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,238
So, what's he like,
anyway?

25
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,239
Who?

26
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,575
Dutch. Reagan.

27
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,508
Ronnie?

28
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,910
Oh, he's a prince.

29
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,980
He's a real class act.

30
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,848
Yeah.

31
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,984
Can I get
a blanket?

32
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,561
This is the actual field,
they tell me.

33
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,996
What?

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,466
It's the actual battlefield--
Massacre at Sioux Falls.

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,669
I think 300 of your people--
braves--

36
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,338
died here, what,
100 years ago?

37
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm from New Jersey.

38
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:26,911
Sure, but--
Yeah, you're-- you're--

39
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:29,146
you're an Indian, right?
So--

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,250
so that-- that--
that's got to be, uh...

41
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:35,519
Got to be what?

42
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:39,022
No, I'm just saying this battle,
it was the last big battle

43
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:43,160
before the end of the--
And what came after--

44
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:44,161
whew!

45
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,962
And, look, I'm a Jew,

46
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:49,166
so believe me,
I know tribulation.

47
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:55,838
Yeah. Smoke?

48
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:02,445
Any minute, he'll be out.

49
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,980
All right, nobody moves.
Everybody is still dead.

50
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:09,066
It is a crisis of confidence.

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,256
It is a crisis that strikes
at the very heart and soul

52
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,458
and spirit of our national will.

53
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,260
_

54
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:21,163
We can see this crisis
in the growing doubt

55
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:24,566
about the meaning
of our own lives

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,002
and in the loss
of a unity of purpose.

57
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:31,306
_

58
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,142
Is he kidding me?

59
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,645
...has been taken out
of the home of John Wayne Gacy...

60
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:40,014
The erosion of our confidence
in the future

61
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:42,149
is threatening to destroy _

62
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:45,819
the social and the political
fabric of America. _

63
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,389
That's what I'm trying
to engage with here

64
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:50,357
is this untapped potential
of yours

65
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:52,059
to sort of think
a little bit.

66
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,694
♪ I can't sing, I ain't pretty
and my legs are thin ♪

67
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,798
Confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

68
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:00,334
♪ I might not give a answer
that you want me to ♪

69
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:12,845
_

70
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:16,649
Hey, there. Sorry.

71
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:17,918
Are you kidding me?

72
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:19,319
You said noon, yeah?

73
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,088
Are you kidding me?

74
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:22,555
Hold on, now--

75
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,424
Said 11:00, not noon.

76
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,592
What?

77
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:27,027
Say that again.

78
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,862
- Okay.
- Say it again.

79
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:30,295
Okay, okay!

80
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,964
Where's the goddamn money?

81
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:34,399
I gave it to Ollie,
like, yesterday.

82
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:37,136
Don't lie.

83
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,370
I mean,
I'm-- I'm getting it.

84
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,739
It's just a little late.

85
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:41,707
The hell you say.
I did the rounds.

86
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:42,908
Everybody paid.

87
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:45,244
'Course they're
gonna say that.

88
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,779
So you got the money.

89
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,914
Well, you know,
maybe I needed it for me,

90
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,415
for something I--

91
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,451
No, you earn for the family,
not for yourself.

92
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:53,918
Yeah.

93
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:56,955
But you're the oldest,
and then there's Bear,

94
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:58,923
and that's the throne.

95
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,225
What am I ever gonna be

96
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,960
except the kid you send out
for milk?

97
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:04,696
You're a Gerhardt.

98
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:07,399
That's like Jupiter
telling Pluto,

99
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,768
"Hey, you're a planet, too."

100
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,469
What?

101
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,036
If I'm this royalty,

102
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:16,440
how come you got me
doing bullshit collections

103
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,142
like some nobody chump?

104
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,543
Everybody earns.

105
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:20,911
That's the law.

106
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,913
Yeah, but what if I got
ambitions, you know?

107
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,916
You wear short pants
till you prove you're a man.

108
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,418
I'm a man.

109
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,254
You're the comic
in a piece of bubble gum!

110
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,357
Well, I mean, says you.

111
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:43,333
You got till tomorrow to bring
the collection money you owe.

112
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,769
Or what?

113
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,706
You make me wait for you again,
I'll cleave your skull.

116

You'll see the problem
right away.

117
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:25,272
Light.

118
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,676
Mm.

119
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:30,110
About time.

120
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:32,146
Give me a break.

121
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:43,557
Soon as you ladies
are done dancing--

122
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:44,591
You're right.

123
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,760
We're light,

124
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:50,564
even though
the transport dollars went up.

125
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,701
It's the local business--
gambling and drugs...

126
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:55,702
and whores.

<i>Meine keine gute soehne?</i>

Don't pin this on me.

129
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:01,040
Or me.

130
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,709
We earned.

131
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:04,611
But not Rye.

132
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:06,145
No.

133
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,613
But even without his nut,

134
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,314
we shouldn't be
this short.

135
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,184
It's like we're a balloon
leaking air all over.

136
00:07:12,218 --> 00:07:14,319
Spit it out.

137
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:15,988
What are we talking
about here?

138
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:18,190
Tell me, God damn it.

139
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,193
Another outfit.

140
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,662
I'm taking care
of it.

141
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,163
From the south.

142
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,766
Don't know where.

143
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,201
- I said I'd handle it.
- They're coming hard.

144
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,236
Son, I'm the iron fist
of God.

145
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,671
There's not a sane man
in three states

146
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:34,939
who would dare to--

147
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:40,011
Some pissant crew
from south no place?

148
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,781
You bring me these
<i>hirnlose mutter fotzen</i>

149
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:45,417
and I'll grind their bones

_

152
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:32,295
All right, hear me.

153
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,399
I'm saying tomorrow
has never been closer

154
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,568
than it is right now.

155
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,404
It's 11:00
in the morning.

156
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,506
Metaphorically, I mean.

157
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,044
Hi, friend.
Be with you in a--

158
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,013
Check never came,
is my point.

159
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,615
I'm owed for work I done.

160
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,450
Me and the boys,
we're owed.

161
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,220
Giddyup there, cowboy.

162
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:00,289
Wait your turn,
short round.

163
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:01,423
What'd you say?

164
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,425
You heard me.

165
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,329
Jesus. Just--

166
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,065
It's in the mail, okay?

167
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,467
The check.

168
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,902
Just-- if it hasn't come
by Tuesday,

169
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,937
I'll write you another.

170
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,641
Yeah, that's right.

171
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,843
You better run.

172
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,215
Come on, now.

173
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:27,849
He could call a cop.

174
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:29,784
He's not calling anybody.

175
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,622
Guys like that, they're just big
on the outside.

176
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,992
So, where's this
miracle contraption?

177
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,794
Behold the future.

178
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,631
I'm talking money
hand over fist.

179
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,165
A typewriter.

180
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:48,182
A self-correcting IBM
Selectric II electric typewriter

181
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:49,792
with patented
high-speed type ball.

182
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:50,972
They're not just
for women anymore.

183
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,807
And you're sure
we're the only--

184
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,875
Sole distributor,
Midwest region.

185
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,512
Assuming you're willing
to forget certain debts

186
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,348
owed to your family
from the, uh--

187
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:02,616
Gambling.

188
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:05,118
Yeah, which, you know,
I'm not proud.

189
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,922
So, as soon as you talk
to the judge

190
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,390
and she unfreezes
the accounts,

191
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:14,061
well, then we can turn on
the money spigot.

192
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:16,564
The what?

193
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:17,932
The spigot.

194
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:20,367
It's like
where you hook up a hose.

195
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,369
Like a fire hose?

196
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:23,703
Any hose.

197
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:25,872
I'm saying once we get
those typewriters,

198
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:28,542
the money--
there'll be no stopping it.

199
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,777

I'm not selling anything.

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,491
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,092
Hey. Your majesty.

248
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:48,162
You're gonna change your mind
about something-- a case.

249
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,997
Or what?

250
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:51,831
Or you'll find out,
is what.

251
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:55,535
This isn't one of those optional
check "A" or "B" scenarios.

252
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:57,370
I'm gonna change your mind.

253
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,910
One day, the Devil came to God
and said,

254
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,346
"Let's make a bet
between you and me

255
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,747
for the soul of a man."

256
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,917
And from on high
they looked down on Job,

257
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,685
a devout man, religious.

258
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,687
And the Devil said,
"I can change his mind

259
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:16,189
and make him
curse your name."

260
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,659
And God said,
"Try and you will only fail."

261
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,861
So the Devil begins.

262
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:24,530
He kills Job's herds
and takes his fields.

263
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:27,933
He plagues him with boils
and throws him on the ash heap.

264
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:32,737
But Job's mind
remains unchanged.

265
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:35,040
So I ask you, son,

266
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:37,742
if the Devil couldn't
change Job's mind,

267
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:40,446
how the hell
are you gonna change mine?

268
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,115
What?

269
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:45,150
You're a little dim,
aren't you?

270
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,253
Listen, this is--

271
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,589
There's two ways
this can go.

272
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,324
- Is one of them the hard way?
- Easy--

273
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:53,992
You know what?

274
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,562
There's a fella needs to get
his hands on some typewriters.

275
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:57,596
Ugh. Christ.

276
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,564
And you're gonna--

277
00:15:58,598 --> 00:15:59,897
You're with that fool.

278
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,333
- Yeah. You're--
- Okay. _

279
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,434
Son, you have three second
to pick your ass up

280
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:04,868
and get out of here,

281
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,637
or I'm gonna squash you
like a bug.

282
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:10,908
Okay, look, bitch--
I'm the one do--

283
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,447
God damn, my eyes.

284
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,749
Now scram
before I call the cops.

285
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:22,720
Oh, crap.

286
00:17:58,147 --> 00:17:59,881
Sh--

287
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:05,821
Shit.

288
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:08,223
Shit.

289
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:12,293
Shit.

290
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:14,495
Shit.

291
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:08,192
"'Oh, whocky!' Cried Joel.

292
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:10,261
'See what you've done,
Polly Pepper?'

293
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:11,862
but Polly didn't hear.

294
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:14,532
Over the big, flat door-stone
she sped and met Ben

295
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:16,834
with Little David
coming in the gate.

296
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,868
His face was just like
Phronsie's!

297
00:20:18,903 --> 00:20:21,371
And with a cold,
heavy feeling at her heart,

298
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:23,206
Polly realized this was no play.

299
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,508
'Oh, Ben!' She cried,

300
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,443
flinging her arms
around his neck

301
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,977
and bursting into tears.

302
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:30,280
'Don't! Please.
I-I wish you wouldn't.

303
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,482
Phronsie's got 'em,
and that's enough.'

304
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:35,152
'Got what?' Asked Ben,

305
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:38,655
while Davie's eyes grew
to their widest proportions.

306
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,891
'Oh, measles!' Cried Polly,
bursting out afresh.

307
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:45,162
'Hatefulest, horridest measles!

308
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:46,896
And now you're taken!'

309
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:49,566
'Oh, no, I ain't,'
responded Ben cheerfully,

310
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,100
who knew what measles were.

311
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,235
'Wipe up, Polly.
I'm all right.'"

312
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,104
"'Only my head aches

313
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:56,873
and my eyes feel funny.'

314
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:00,509
Polly, only half reassured,
gulped down her sobs

315
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:03,746
and the sorrowful trio
repaired to mother.

316
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:07,283
'Oh, dear me,'
ejaculated Mrs. Pepper,

317
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:11,554
sinking in a chair at the dismay
at the sight of Ben's red face.

318
00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:14,924
'Whatever will we do now?'"

319
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,126
This is a funny book, huh?

320
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Yeah.

321
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,996
- Yeah.
- Phone call, hon.

322
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,163
It's the shop.

323
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:24,900
Okay, you.

324
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:25,901
Sleep, huh?

325
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:27,235
Okay.

326
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,071
I'll be back in a minute
to tuck you in.

327
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:31,106
Okay.

328
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,777
Murder, Eunice says.

329
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:39,180
Three of them
over at the Waffle Hut.

330
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,117
Hey, uh, you--
you had your thing today.

331
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,451
Yeah. This morning.

332
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:45,153
You feel okay?

333
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,122
Compared to what?

334
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:49,390
Love Canal?

335
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,559
Hmm?

336
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:53,661
Solverson.

337
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:57,164
Yeah, okay.

338
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:58,666
Tell him not to go inside.

339
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,400
Hank on his way?

340
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:05,740
Okay. You too.

341
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:06,907
Got to go, hon.

342
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,609
You okay
getting her to bed?

343
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:12,446
Yeah. She's six,
not, you know, Pol Pot.

344
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,283
Okay. Call if you need,
you know, whatever.

345
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:17,885
Mm-hmm.

346
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,218
I left my rig there.
I hope that's okay.

347
00:22:54,421 --> 00:22:57,456
I'm the one
who called it in, see?

348
00:22:57,491 --> 00:23:00,125
Stopped for waffles,
you know?

349
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,860
With the blueberries.

350
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:05,331
They come frozen this time
of year, I know, but...

351
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,840
I-I put my coat on her.

352
00:23:14,874 --> 00:23:16,709
It seemed only right.

353
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,624
Yeah.

354
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:37,129
"Yeah," it's okay
about the coat, or...?

355
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,894
Yeah.

356
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,954
Well, this is a deal.

357
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,290
I count three dead.

358
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,661
Saw the waitress
in the parking lot?

359
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:46,296
Mm.

360
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,265
I think she caught one there,
then staggered out.

361
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,702
Gunman followed,
made things permanent.

362
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:03,313
That's Henry Blanton.

363
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:07,784
Got the single-season touchdown
record in 10th grade.

364
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:13,255
31.

365
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,457
Still stands.

366
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:27,303
Yeah. Don't know her.

367
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:31,473
North Dakota plates
on a Mercedes outside.

368
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:33,342
Tourist,
you're thinking?

369
00:25:33,376 --> 00:25:35,377
Mm...

370
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:43,818
How's Betsy?

371
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:47,555
You mean you didn't call her
before you came over?

372
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,424
Well, yeah.

373
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:53,027
Just being polite.

374
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:55,429
Give you a chance
to talk about your feelings,

375
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:57,365
should you be
so disposed.

376
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:01,035
She's good. Yeah.

377
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,638
Ordered this kit
of recipe cards.

378
00:26:04,673 --> 00:26:07,041
Saw it on the TV.

379
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:09,877
So now every night,
we eat delicacies of the world.

380
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:12,512
Mm. Some men like that.

381
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:13,813
Variety.

382
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:15,582
Mm.

383
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:19,219
She put a soufflé
on the table last night--

384
00:26:19,254 --> 00:26:21,388
perfectly good casserole--

385
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:24,657
and lit it on fire
with a kitchen match.

386
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:26,326
Huh?

387
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,161
Oh, which reminds me--

388
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:31,164
you're invited
for dinner tomorrow.

389
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:33,367
- 6:00?
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:36,036
I'll bring a suit of armor.

391
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:56,241
Skid marks.

392
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:59,043
Yeah. I see them.

393
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,413
'Course, connecting those
to this deal here

394
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:04,149
would be what we call
"jumping to a conclusion."

395
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:11,856
Based on
the number of bodies,

396
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:16,127
I'm thinking we've got one car
too many in the parking lot.

397
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:21,465
Yeah.

398
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:25,169
So, the shooter's got
a wound or two in him

399
00:27:25,203 --> 00:27:26,604
from the steak knife.

400
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:28,472
Two blood trails lead out.

401
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:31,142
One to the waitress,
now deceased.

402
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:35,446
The other to the road here,
where he absconds,

403
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,281
leaving a few dollars
behind.

404
00:27:37,315 --> 00:27:38,783
Uh-huh.

405
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:42,286
Why not take his own car?

406
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,155
Unclear at this time.

407
00:27:51,063 --> 00:27:53,164
There's a shoe
in that tree.

408
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:57,768
There sure is.

409
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:03,206
So, uh, this a local matter
or do the State Police want it?

410
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,508
We do not.

411
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:07,110
Local matter it is.

412
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,444
And, of course, any support
the State can provide.

413
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,013
Yeah, of course.

414
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:11,815
See you tomorrow night,
then, eh?

415
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:13,717
6:00.

416
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:16,553
Be ready for anything.

417
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:22,926
That's a shoe, all right.

418
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:38,160
Okay, then.

419
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,928
Okay, then.

420
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:42,331
Noreen?

421
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:44,533
Hmm?

422
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:45,901
Ed's leaving.

423
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:47,969
Okay, then.

424
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:50,638
Oh, hey. May as well
take these with you.

425
00:28:50,673 --> 00:28:54,242
Boolie Hendricks paid
but never picked them up.

426
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,245
Chops?

427
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,080
Mm.
Wasted meat's a crime.

428
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:01,983
Or it should be.

429
00:29:02,018 --> 00:29:02,984
Okay, then.

430
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:03,985
Okay, then.

431
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,253
Okay, then.

432
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:22,303
B-8. B-8.

433
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:24,739
So, Ho Chi Minh--

434
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:26,207
Jesus, kid. Keep up.

435
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,576
Ho Chi Minh
was just a front man.

436
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,912
Enemy number one
straight out of central casting.

437
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:36,050
AKA a stuffed shirt for
the military industrial complex.

438
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:37,485
The what's that, now?

439
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,386
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

440
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,121
Ike's farewell address?

441
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,657
The military
industrial complex.

442
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:45,726
Wheels inside wheels,
special interests.

443
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,164
N-33. N-33.

444
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:52,933
I thought
there'd be a band tonight.

445
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:55,502
- Boys.
- I-17.

446
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:58,038
I-17.

447
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:00,474
Balls.

448
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:04,177
Tell this dipshit pissant
about Ike's farewell address.

449
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:08,281
You mean
the military industrial complex?

450
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:11,384
See? He knows.

451
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:13,452
'Course,
we've been to war.

452
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:15,989
Nothing complex about it.

453
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,625
How come
you're in uniform, then, Lou?

454
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,160
Didn't you work
this morning?

455
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,728
Three dead
at the Waffle Hut.

456
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:23,997
No shit.

457
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,232
Yeah, a real mess.

458
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:27,767
Women, too.

459
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:29,068
Hank's thinking
botched robbery.

460
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,536
Oh, sure.

461
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,438
That's what
they <i>want</i> you to think.

462
00:30:32,472 --> 00:30:33,706
Who?

463
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,774
They.

464
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:36,675
B-11.

465
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,176
You know,
the powers that be.

466
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,745
It's a classic story.

467
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,213
Oswald acted alone.

468
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:43,716
The girl
in the polka-dot dress.

469
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,850
The what, now?

470
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:47,553
The girl in the--

471
00:30:48,988 --> 00:30:52,391
After Kennedy the other
was shot-- Robert, in LA--

472
00:30:52,426 --> 00:30:54,993
People saw a woman
in a polka-dot dress

473
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:58,063
running out of the hotel
yelling, "We got him!"

474
00:30:58,097 --> 00:30:59,163
But who did they arrest?

475
00:30:59,197 --> 00:31:03,668
I-23. I-23.

476
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:07,572
An A-rab. Racist pricks.

477
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:10,274
It's a diner robbery
in Minnesota, Karl.

478
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,577
Not a presidential
assassination.

479
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:13,945
Oh, sure.

480
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:15,413
That's how it starts--
with something small

481
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:18,683
like a break-in
at the Watergate Hotel.

482
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:19,951
But just watch.

483
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:22,854
This thing's
only getting bigger.

484
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:27,058
G-53. G-53.

485
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,929
Well, I better get home.

486
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,230
Betsy had
her chemo today.

487
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:34,765
God!

488
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,434
What is it, Karl?

489
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:39,002
It's just-- God damn.

490
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:41,171
Unacceptable

491
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:44,240
A woman like that
in the prime of her...

492
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:46,176
With a young daughter.

493
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,745
N-40. N-40.

494
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,714
Tell her if John McCain
could hold out

495
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:54,284
for 5 1/2 years
against Viet Cong thumbscrews,

496
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:57,120
she can beat this cancer
bullshit in her sleep.

497
00:31:57,154 --> 00:32:00,190
I'll make sure
to mention that.

and never picked them up,

504
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:21,344
so I figured...

505
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:23,679
- Hi.

an accomplice and a getaway car?

524
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,527
Your dad called.

525
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:48,963
You know him.

526
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:54,366
Likes to talk things through
before he goes to bed.

527
00:33:58,005 --> 00:33:59,338
We got glasses.

528
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:04,510
Tastes different
in a glass.

529
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,178
Molly go down okay?

530
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,147
Mm-hmm.

531
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:12,685
Oh, you know,
I forgot earlier--

532
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,854
She made you something
at school today.

533
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,187
Yeah?

534
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,960
She knows
I don't smoke, right?

535
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:23,294
You could start.

536
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,867
Hmm.

537
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,803
Your dad said he'd be over
Sunday in a suit of armor.

538
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:33,204
Ugh. Geez.

539
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,641
You light one soufflé
on fire--

540
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:59,916
So, I'm getting excited
about this seminar.

541
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:01,451
- The which?
- You remember, hon.

542
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:03,386
It's next weekend.
Constance is taking me.

543
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,387
Lifespring.

544
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:05,921
Everybody's doing it.

545
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:07,657
Oh, yeah.

546
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,159
I really think this course

547
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,561
is gonna help me actualize,
you know, fully.

548
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:14,063
Re-examine
old reflex patterns--

549
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:16,966
the ones that keep my life
from working.

550
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,402
From...

551
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:21,371
'Cause <i>we're</i> doing great,
yeah?

552
00:35:21,405 --> 00:35:23,306
Oh, yeah.

553
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,708
I just mean me, you know?

554
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:27,109
As a person.

555
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:28,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

556
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,948
Well, Bud asked again
if I was interested

557
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:37,118
in maybe taking over
the butcher shop.

558
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:38,487
Mm.

559
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:41,323
Said he's thinking of retiring
end of the year.

560
00:35:41,357 --> 00:35:44,059
Just had
the end of the year, huh?

561
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:45,594
Yeah, I guess he means
this year,

562
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:48,497
but wouldn't that be great?

563
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,301
Me owning the shop,

564
00:35:52,335 --> 00:35:54,036
maybe you take over
the salon one day.

565
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,906
You know, unless we got
a whole litter of kids by then.

566
00:35:59,942 --> 00:36:02,811
Yeah, that's--
We talked about that.

567
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:07,148
We're trying,
but it takes time, you know?

568
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:08,116
Yeah.

569
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,818
Yeah, of course.

570
00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:14,422
Though, uh... hon--

571
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:17,759
"trying"-- I mean,
last time I checked,

572
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:21,696
there's just the one way
to make a baby, you know?

573
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:23,797
Did that last weekend,
didn't we?

574
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:25,098
It was Bear Lake last weekend.

575
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,199
You said
you didn't want to--

576
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:28,802
- not with Kevin and Sally--
- Hon.

577
00:36:28,837 --> 00:36:32,239
I ju-- I just-- uh--

578
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,910
I just love you, is all.

579
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,846
So, so much.

580
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,584
And, come on,
our kids would be amazing.

581
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,255
Oh, shoot!

582
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,189
Here.

583
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:50,524
Hon, let me--

584
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,092
No, it-it's fine.

585
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,293
I'm-- I'm such
a bumble sometimes.

586
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:55,529
What the heck?

587
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:58,365
I-I love you, too, hon,
so, so much.

588
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:04,037
Maybe we should...
Maybe do it right now.

589
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:05,172
Here?

590
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:08,075
No, silly.
In the bedroom.

591
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,242
Come on.

592
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:14,146
Geez. I better go see
what that...

593
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:15,714
We can--

594
00:37:15,748 --> 00:37:17,516
I'll wear that nightie
you like.

595
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:22,588
What the--

596
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:25,391
Hon?

597
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:41,039
Didn't I tell you?

598
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:43,141
I kind of hit a deer.

599
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:46,177
You hit a...

600
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:50,315
Are you-- you okay?

601
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:53,551
Yeah, no, I-I'm just,
you know, shook up, mostly.

602
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:58,089
Geez.

603
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:05,763
Well, insurance
should cover most--

604
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:10,901
Actually, I-- I think
I need to sit down, hon.

605
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,638
Can we go
in the kitchen?

606
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,811
Heck, hon,
did you bring the deer home?

607
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:26,915
Hon, don't.

608
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:34,590
Hon.

609
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:38,561
Hon, don't.

610
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:42,431
Hon! Come back!

611
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:48,037
Don't.

612
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:50,039
Ah, geez.

613
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:52,074
T-there's a--

614
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:53,909
It's a man.
There's a man in the--

615
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,344
Oh, my God.

616
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:33,981
Oh, my God.

617
00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:38,320
Oh-- oh, my God.

618
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:40,988
Hon.

619
00:39:41,023 --> 00:39:42,390
Geez, hon.

620
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:44,693
Sorry. Are y-you okay?

621
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,161
No, it's-- I'm fine.

622
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:51,265
- Who--
- You got to believe me.

623
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,666
I-I thought he was dead.

624
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,000
What?

625
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:55,936
When I hit him,
I thought he was--

626
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,003
You hit <i>him?</i>

627
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,909
You hit <i>him</i> with the car?

628
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:04,211
You-- you said a deer.

629
00:40:30,872 --> 00:40:33,406
You hit him.

630
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,276
Why-- why didn't you go to
the police or the hospital?

631
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:41,081
He ran out
into the road, hon.

632
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:43,917
What was I supposed to do?

633
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,853
Yeah, so--
so you brought him home,

634
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:50,223
made dinner--
Hamburger Helper.

635
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,969
I panicked, okay?

636
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:12,077
We-- we got to call
the police.

637
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:13,578
Why didn't you call
the police?

638
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:14,914
- No.
- We gotta-- Maybe he's not--

639
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:16,515
No, no. No. I-- I--

640
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:19,351
Hon, listen to me.

641
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,853
I ran over him.
Hit and run.

642
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:24,323
And-- and then you stabbed him
with a gardening tool.

643
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,758
The cops-- do you think
they're gonna believe us?

644
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:28,126
I don't know.

645
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,461
But-- but people are gonna
look for him.

646
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:31,162
But-- but look. Look.

647
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,531
I-I was careful.

648
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:35,300
I-I drove the back way
all the way home.

649
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:36,968
You drove the--

650
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:39,003
Hon, a-a man's dead.

651
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,741
Well, that's why
we have to clean it up and--

652
00:41:43,775 --> 00:41:47,277
and tell people
I hit a deer or...

653
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:51,482
We could run.

654
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:53,250
What?

655
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:54,284
Go to California.

656
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,019
Calif--

657
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:58,456
No.

658
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:02,326
We have a life here, hon.

659
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:04,528
A family.
I'm gonna buy the shop.

660
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,629
- Okay, then. - Okay, then.
- Okay, then.

661
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:08,498
And we're gonna start
a f-family.

662
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:11,000
Well, start again,
I'm saying.

663
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:12,669
I don't want to.

664
00:42:12,703 --> 00:42:15,038
Okay, then...

665
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:16,206
You--

666
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,375
Then, hon, look at me.

667
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:22,779
If we're gonna
get clear of this,

668
00:42:22,813 --> 00:42:25,182
then we're gonna have to
clean it up.

669
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:27,684
Pretend it didn't happen.

670
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:31,688
'Cause if this comes out,
if this--

671
00:42:31,722 --> 00:42:34,290
then all the things
you want,

672
00:42:34,324 --> 00:42:36,725
that <i>we</i> want--
that's over.

673
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:43,765
I go to jail
and maybe you also.

674
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,936
And then there's no shop
and no family.

675
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:50,372
No kids.

676
00:42:58,715 --> 00:43:00,216
Okay.

677
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:05,386
Okay, then.
We--

678
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:08,556
we clean it up.

679
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:10,891
We clean it up.

680
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:40,181
Well, should we call that
Saturday?

681
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:42,283
I suppose we better.

682
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:45,453
She'll be up at 5:00 anyway
wanting to play dolls.

683
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:48,456
And I know how fond you are
of your doll-playing time.

684
00:44:02,904 --> 00:44:06,040
Good night,
Mr. Solverson.

685
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:10,244
Good night, Mrs. Solverson,
and all the ships at sea.

686
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:43,376
O-Otto?

687
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:51,151
Otto! No!

688
00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:52,419
No!

689
00:44:52,453 --> 00:44:54,754
Oh! Otto!

690
00:44:54,788 --> 00:44:56,656
Live!

691
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,758
Get the doctor! Go now!

692
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:00,860
Now!

693
00:45:00,894 --> 00:45:03,029
Otto.
Call the doctor. Go!

694
00:45:19,113 --> 00:45:20,913
_

695
00:45:20,914 --> 00:45:24,684
So, as you see
on page 16 of the prospectus,

696
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:29,088
the main component of our
Northern expansion strategy

697
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:33,159
involves the absorption of
the Gerhardt Family Syndicate,

698
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:37,329
headquartered in Fargo, ND.

699
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:40,166
Now, the Gerhardts control
trucking and distribution

700
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,636
for the entire Northern Midwest.

701
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,472
It's a family business
started in 1931

702
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:49,475
by Dieter Gerhardt...

703
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,777
...now deceased,

704
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:56,081
and taken over in 1950
by his son Otto.

705
00:45:56,115 --> 00:45:57,583
Now, not in the report

706
00:45:57,617 --> 00:45:59,885
but of relevance
to this meeting,

707
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:01,853
Old Otto had a stroke yesterday

708
00:46:01,888 --> 00:46:04,490
in the family compound
in North Dakota.

709
00:46:04,524 --> 00:46:07,025
Leaving who in charge?

710
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,761
Unclear.

711
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:15,267
His wife, Floyd, she's tough,
but, you know, a girl.

712
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:20,037
And then there are the three
sons-- Dodd, Bear, and Rye.

713
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:23,441
And of course they all want
their shot at the throne,

714
00:46:23,475 --> 00:46:26,444
which the boys in Research
think provides

715
00:46:26,478 --> 00:46:30,548
a tactical opportunity for us
to move aggressively

716
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:34,586
to acquire or absorb
their operation.

717
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:39,557
And if you can't

718
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:43,361
and the current
business owners resist?

719
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:46,698
We liquidate.

720
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:55,539
Approved.
