2
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,440
People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,320
Three minutes.

4
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,640
This is it. Ground zero.

5
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,240
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

6
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,720
With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.

7
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I can't think of anything.

8
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,600
For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing

9
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
and I wonder how clean that gun is.

10
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
It's getting exciting now.

11
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,960
That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.

12
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Well, it works both ways.

13
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,240
We have front-rowseats
for this theatre of mass destruction.

14
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,960
The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem

15
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,360
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.

16
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,320
ln two minutes,
primary charges will blowbase charges

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,640
and a fewblocks willbe reduced
to smouldering rubble.

18
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,640
I know this because Tyler knows this.

19
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,960
Two and a haIf.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

20
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,200
Suddenly I realise that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,

21
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,440
has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,120
Bob. Bob hadbitch tits.

23
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,440
The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.

25
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,600
We're still men.

26
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,800
Yes, we're men.

27
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,960
Men is what we are.

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,360
Bob had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,080
He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high

30
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,200
and his body upped the oestrogen.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,840
- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.

32
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,280
..between those huge sweating tits

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
that hung enormous,
the wayyou'd think of God's as big.

34
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,640
OK, you cry now.

35
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,160
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
For six months, I couldn't sleep.

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,520
I couldn't sleep.

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,680
With insomnia, nothing's real.

39
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Everything's far away.

40
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,920
Everything's a copy of a copy

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,960
of a copy.

42
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,520
When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.

43
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
The IBM Stellar Sphere.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
The Microsoft Galaxy.

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
The Planet Starbucks.

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,440
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,960
It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his corn flower blue tie.

48
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,440
You want me to deprioritise my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

49
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,920
Prioritise these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,720
He was full of pep.
Must have hadhis grande latte enema.

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,720
Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.

52
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes. I'd like to order

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

54
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,440
- Please hold.
- Anything clever,

55
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,720
like a coffee table in the shape ofa yin-yang,
I had to have it.

56
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,000
The Klipsk personal office unit.

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,280
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,040
Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.

59
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,360
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
I'd flip through catalogues and wonder

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,160
''What kind of dining set
defiines me as a person?''

62
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,840
I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,800
proof that they were craftedby the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,720
- Please hold.
- ..wherever.

65
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,240
We used to read pornography.

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,040
Now it was the Horchow collection.

67
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,360
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

68
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,720
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I have no idea how I got there.

70
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,520
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,080
Red andblue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...

72
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,760
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,800
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Hey, come on.

75
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,360
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,400
See the guys with testicular cancer.

78
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
That's pain.

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

80
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,360
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

81
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,280
We never could agree on anything.

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,320
well, I... She...

83
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
She had her first child last week.

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,040
A girl.

85
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
With... With her... With her new husband.

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Fuck!

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Thank God, you know...

88
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm glad for her.

89
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,960
She deserves...

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,320
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

91
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Thank you, Thomas.

92
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,800
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
And that gives me strength.

94
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,200
We give each other strength.

95
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,480
It's time for the one-on-ones.

96
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,280
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

97
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Could you find a partner?

98
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,480
And this is how I met the big moosie.

99
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,160
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.

100
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,200
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.

101
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

102
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,080
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.

103
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,680
You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?

104
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
That was his idea.

105
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I was ajuicer.

106
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,960
You know, using steroids?

107
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,440
Diabonal and

108
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,760
Wisterol.

109
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,600
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

110
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
And now I'm bankrupt.

111
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
I'm divorced.

112
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
My two grown kids

113
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,040
won't even return my phone calls.

114
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,000
Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.

115
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
You can cry.

117
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,200
And then... something happened.
I let go.

118
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
That's really good.

119
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Lost in oblivion.

120
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,640
Dark and silent and complete.

121
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,080
I foundfreedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.

122
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
It's OK.

123
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,720
Babies don't sleep this well.

124
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,680
I became addicted.

125
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
If I didn't say anything

126
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
people always assumed the worst.

127
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,080
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

128
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

129
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I wasn't really dying.

130
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,960
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.

131
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,680
I was the warm little centre
that the life of this world crowded around.

132
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,360
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

133
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,400
It moves over your body, healing you.

134
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,840
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

135
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,480
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

136
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,320
Where does it lead?

137
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,440
To your cave.

138
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,320
Step forward

139
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,520
into your cave.

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
That's right.

141
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,000
You're going deeper into your cave.

142
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
And you're going to find

143
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
your power animal.

144
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,080
Slide.

145
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Every evening I died.

146
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,400
And every evening I was born again.

147
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Resurrected.

148
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.

149
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,720
Being there, pressed against his tits,

150
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
ready to cry.

151
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,440
This was my vacation.

152
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,200
And she

153
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,840
ruined everything.

154
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,920
This is cancer, right?

155
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,840
This chick, Marla Singer,

156
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,480
did not have testicular cancer.

157
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
She was a liar.

158
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
She had no diseases at all.

159
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,360
I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.

160
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,760
Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.

161
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,000
And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.

162
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,000
Marla,

163
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,480
the big tourist.

164
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Her lie reflected my lie.

165
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
And suddenly, I felt nothing.

166
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,640
I couldn't cry. So once again,

167
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I couldn't sleep.

168
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,640
Next group, after guided meditation,

169
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,000
after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,

170
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.

171
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,040
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

172
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,320
I hadn't slept in four days.

173
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,200
We'll just let that dry...

174
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,600
When you have insomnia,
you're never really a sleep.

175
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,040
And you're never really awake.

176
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,560
To begin tonight's communion,

177
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,280
Chloe would like to say a few words.

178
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Oh, yeah. Chloe.

179
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,800
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around

180
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
being extra nice to everybody.

181
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
well, I'm still here.

182
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,720
But I don't know for how long.

183
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

184
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,480
But I've got some good news.

185
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,160
I no longer have any fear of death.

186
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,520
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

187
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
No-one will have sex with me.

188
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,840
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

189
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,760
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

190
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,400
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

191
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,120
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

192
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,240
Thank you, Chloe.

193
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,640
Now, let's ready our selves
for guided meditation.

194
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,960
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

195
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,760
You step inside your cave and you walk...

196
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,840
If I did have a tumour, I'd name it Marla.

197
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
Marla.

198
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,120
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would healif you could stop tonguing it.

199
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
But you can't.

200
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,840
..deeper into your cave as you walk.

201
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,320
You feel a healing energy all around you.

202
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Now find your power animal.

203
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Slide.

204
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,200
OK. Let's partner up.

205
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,520
Pick someone special to you tonight.

206
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Hey.

207
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

208
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
- I'm onto you.
- What?

209
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

210
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,320
Sorry?

211
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,200
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

212
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,320
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

213
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,880
So you're a tourist.

214
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,000
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

215
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,480
I saw you at testicular cancer!

216
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,160
I saw you practising this.

217
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,560
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

218
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,320
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

219
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,120
I'll expose you.

220
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

221
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,680
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

222
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

223
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,160
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

224
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,880
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

225
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,000
I've been coming for over a year.

226
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,160
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

227
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,920
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,880
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

229
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Yeah. Yeah.

230
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,000
Share yourself... completely.

231
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Look, you don't want to get into this.

232
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

233
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

234
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

235
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,600
Candy stripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

236
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
No, wait a second. Hold on.

237
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
We'll split up the week, OK?

238
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,880
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

239
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

240
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,200
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

241
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,040
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

242
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,400
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

243
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,440
No. No.

244
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,040
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

245
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,800
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

246
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,040
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

247
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,760
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

248
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,240
So far, you have four. I only have two.

249
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,080
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

250
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,360
Now we both have three...

251
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,520
Hey! You left half your clothes.

252
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,440
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

253
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm selling some clothes!

254
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
So! We each have three. That's six.

255
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,400
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

256
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
The girl had done her homework.

257
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

258
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
That's your favourite too?

259
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,640
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

260
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
Take the first and third Sunday.

261
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,880
Deal.

262
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,600
Looks like this is good bye.

263
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

264
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,160
How's this for not making a big thing?

265
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
Hey, MarIa!

266
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,600
MarIa!

267
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,160
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

268
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,080
Should we?

269
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,080
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

270
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,480
This is how I met Marla Singer.

271
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,200
Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.

272
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,480
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.

273
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,440
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

274
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,320
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

275
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
You wake up at Sea Tac.

276
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,080
SFO. LAX.

277
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,440
You wake up at O'Hare.

278
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,560
Dallas Fort Worth.

279
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,520
BWI.

280
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,240
Pacifiic. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.

281
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,040
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

282
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,280
This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.

283
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
You wake up at Air Harbor International.

284
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,280
If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,

285
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,920
could you wake up as a different person?

286
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Everywhere I travel,

287
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
tiny life.

288
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,760
Single-serving sugar and cream.

289
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,560
Single pat of butter.

290
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,360
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.

291
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,320
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

292
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,120
Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.

293
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,920
The people I meet on each flight,

294
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,040
they're single-serving friends.

295
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,680
Between take off and landing,
we have our time together.

296
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,920
That's all we get.

297
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,840
Welcome!

298
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,840
On a long enough time line,
the survivalrate for everyone drops to zero.

299
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,520
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.

300
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,880
The infant went through the wind shield.

301
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
A new carbuilt by my company
leaves somewhere travelling at 60mph.

302
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
The rear differential locks up.

303
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,440
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ash tray.

304
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,800
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

305
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,240
The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.

306
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,520
Now, should we initiate a recall?

307
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
The father must have been huge.

308
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,760
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

309
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
Very modern art.

310
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,240
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.

311
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,920
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,640
Multiply the result by
the average out-of-courtsettlement, C.

313
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
A xB x C

314
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,760
equaIs X.

315
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,320
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

316
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,360
we don't do one.

317
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,520
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

318
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,440
You wouldn't believe.

319
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,280
Which car company do you work for?

320
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
A major one.

321
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,520
Every time the plane banked too sharply
on take off or landing,

322
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,760
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.

323
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,880
Anything.

324
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,960
Life insurance pays offtriple
if you die on a business trip.

325
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,960
''If you are seated in an emergency exit row

326
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,400
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

327
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,760
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you.''

328
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,440
It's a lot of responsibility.

329
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,640
Wanna switch seats?

330
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,040
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.

331
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,320
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

332
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
The illusion of safety.

333
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Yeah. I guess so.

334
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,520
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

335
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,960
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

336
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,440
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

337
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,920
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,200
You accept your fate.

339
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,760
It's all right here.

340
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,880
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

341
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,680
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

342
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
That's...

343
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,120
That's an interesting theory.

344
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,080
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

345
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
What do you do for a living?

346
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,280
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

347
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,240
OK.

348
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,080
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

349
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
We have the exact same briefcase.

350
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,920
Soap.

351
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,560
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

352
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,920
The yard stick of civilisation.

353
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,320
And this is how I met...

354
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,160
Tyler Durden.

355
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,280
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

356
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,200
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

357
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,960
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

358
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,400
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

359
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,040
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

360
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,800
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

361
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,360
Thank you.

362
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,480
How's it working out for you?

363
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,200
- What?
- Being cIever?

364
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,560
Great.

365
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,520
Keep it up, then. Right up.

366
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
A question of etiquette.

367
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,680
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

368
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,680
How I came to live with Tyler is...

369
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,840
Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

370
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,680
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

371
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,800
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

372
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,040
But when a suitcase vibrates,

373
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,720
the throwers have got to call the police.

374
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,160
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out often

375
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
it's an electric razor.

376
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,360
But... every once in a while

377
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,160
it's a dildo.

378
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,800
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

379
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,600
We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never

380
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,680
your dildo.

381
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
I don't own...

382
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,320
I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.

383
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,440
My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.

384
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,280
Never mind.

385
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,680
Hey! That's my car!

386
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,640
Home was a condo on the 15th floor

387
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,640
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.

388
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,240
The walls were solid concrete.

389
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
A foot of concrete is important

390
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,480
when your next-door neighbour
has to watch game shows at full volume.

391
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,280
Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects

392
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,240
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.

393
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,640
I suppose these things happen.

394
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
There's... nothing up there.

395
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,280
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

396
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,040
Do you have somebody you can call?

397
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,160
How embarrassing.

398
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,000
A houseful of condiments and no food.

399
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,680
The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out

400
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,480
letting out just a little bit of gas.

401
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,720
That gas could have filled the condo.

402
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,200
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.

403
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,680
Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.

404
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Yeah?

405
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I can hearyou breathing...

406
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,760
If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.

407
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,360
- Hello?
- Who's this?

408
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
- Tyler?
- Who is this?

409
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,120
We met... We met on the airplane.

410
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,360
We had the same suitcase?

411
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,440
The clever guy?

412
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,760
Oh, yeah. Right.

413
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,240
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

414
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,320
- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'dyou. I never pick up my phone.

415
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So what's up?

416
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,600
well.

417
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
You're not gonna believe this.

418
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,840
You know, it could be worse.

419
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,520
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

420
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,480
There's always that. I don't know.

421
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,560
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourseIf, that's it.

422
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
That's the last sofa I'll need.

423
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,400
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

424
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,800
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

425
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,280
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

426
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,440
I was close to being complete.

427
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,960
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- all gone.

428
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,680
all gone.

429
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,840
Do you know what a duvet is?

430
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,680
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

431
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,600
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

432
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

433
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,320
No.

434
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,320
What are we, then?

435
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,880
I dunno. Consumers.

436
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Right. We're consumers.

437
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,200
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

438
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,040
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

439
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,400
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

440
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
television with 500 channels,

441
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,120
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

442
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Viagra. Olestra.

443
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,000
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

444
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,440
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

445
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,120
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

446
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,360
I say never be complete.

447
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,400
I say stop being perfect.

448
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,440
I say let's evolve.

449
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,720
Let the chips fall where they may.

450
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
But that's me, and I couId be wrong.

451
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

452
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,360
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

453
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,040
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

454
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,600
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

455
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,440
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

456
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,840
What?

457
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,920
The things you own end up owning you.

458
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Do what you like, man.

459
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,160
Oh, it's late.

460
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,840
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

461
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I shouId find a hotel.

462
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
What?

463
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,280
What?

464
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

465
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,400
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

466
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,080
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

467
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,600
What?

468
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,240
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

469
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,600
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

470
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,160
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

471
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,040
would... would that be a problem?

472
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Is it a problem for you to ask?

473
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,240
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

474
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Thanks.

475
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,400
- I want you to do me a favour.
- Yeah, sure.

476
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,800
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

477
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,760
What?

478
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,520
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

479
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,400
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.

480
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,840
Tyler was a nightperson.

481
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,080
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

482
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,200
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

483
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,160
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

484
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,800
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

485
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,000
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

486
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,840
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner ofthe screen.

487
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,520
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

488
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
That's the cue for a changeover.

489
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,240
He fIips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

490
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,480
Why would anyone want this shit job?

491
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,600
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

492
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,080
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

493
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,960
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the ceIebrity voices first meet,

494
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,080
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

495
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,200
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

496
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,720
Nice, big cock.

497
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,000
Even a humming bird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

498
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,920
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

499
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,280
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

500
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,560
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

501
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,880
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

502
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,400
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

503
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,440
Go ahead, tell'em.

504
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,440
You get the idea.

505
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,720
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favour.

506
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,040
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

507
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,960
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourseIf if you haven't!

508
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,280
I don't wanna die without any scars.

509
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,480
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

510
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,760
So go crazy! Let it rip.

511
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,400
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

512
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

513
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,880
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

514
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
That's right.

515
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,120
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

516
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
This is so fucking stupid.

517
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,720
Motherfucker!

518
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
He hit me in the ear!

519
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,960
- well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

520
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

521
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,760
No, that was perfect.

522
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,160
No, it's all right.

523
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
It really hurts.

524
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Right.

525
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,840
Hit me again.

526
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,960
No, you hit me. Come on!

527
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,600
We should do this again sometime.

528
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,000
- Where's your car?
- What car?

529
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,360
I don't know how Tyler found that house

530
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,600
but he said he'd been there for a year.

531
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,440
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.

532
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,840
Most of the windows were boarded up.

533
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,040
There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or who ever, kicked it in.

534
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,120
The stairs were ready to collapse.

535
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,640
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.

536
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,120
Neither would have surprised me.

537
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
Yep. That's you.

538
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,520
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

539
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah, thanks.

540
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,520
What a shit hole.

541
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,480
Nothing worked.

542
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,760
Turning on one lightmeant
another lightin the house went out.

543
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,440
There were no neighbours.
Just warehouses and a papermill.

544
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,360
That fartsmell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell ofwood chips.

545
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,320
What have we here?

546
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,560
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

547
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,040
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.

548
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,120
By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.

549
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,320
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.

550
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Can I be next?

551
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,440
all right, man.

552
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,440
Lose the tie.

553
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,480
At night, Tyler and I were alone
for halfa mile in every direction.

554
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,480
Rain trickled down through
the plasterand the lightfiixtures.

555
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,280
Everything wooden swelledandshrank.

556
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,440
Everywhere were rustednails
to snagyour elbow on.

557
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,000
The previous occupant hadbeen a shut-in.

558
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Hey, man. What are you reading?

559
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,360
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

560
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,080
''I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

561
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,480
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing.''

562
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
There's a whoIe series of these.

563
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
''I Am Jill's NippIes.''

564
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,400
- ''I Am Jack's Colon.''
- ''I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack.''

565
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,160
After fiighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.

566
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,720
What?

567
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,200
- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?

568
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,160
If you could choose,
who would you fight?

569
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I'd fight my boss, probably.

570
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,360
Really?

571
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,640
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

572
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
I don't know my dad.

573
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,640
I mean, I know him, but...

574
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,000
He left when I was like, six years oId.

575
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,960
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

576
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
He did this every six years.

577
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,080
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

578
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
My dad never went to college.

579
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,720
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

580
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,080
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, ''Dad, now what?''

581
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,080
- He says, ''Get ajob.''
- Same here.

582
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,720
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

583
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,720
''Dad, now what?''

584
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,840
He says, ''I dunno. Get married.''

585
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,240
You can't get married.

586
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

587
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,440
We're a generation of men raised by women.

588
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,600
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

589
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,440
Most ofthe week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.

590
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,600
But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.

591
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,080
We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.

592
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,320
It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.

593
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Polish my Scandinavian furniture.

594
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,320
I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.

595
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,040
I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.

596
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,960
But I wasn't.

597
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,560
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

598
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,360
Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.

599
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,360
Can I get the icon in corn flower blue?

600
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,520
Absolutely.

601
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,720
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

602
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,520
Because waste is a thief.

603
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

604
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,880
You can swallowa pint of blood
before you getsick.

605
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,040
It was rightin everyone's face.

606
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,200
Tyler and I just made it visible.

607
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,600
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.

608
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Tyler and I just gave it a name.

609
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Come on, you've gotta go home!

610
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,960
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

611
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,600
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.

612
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
Gentlemen!

613
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Welcome to Fight Club.

614
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,520
The first rule of Fight Club is

615
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,880
you do not talk about Fight Club.

616
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,440
The second rule of Fight Club is

617
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,160
you do not talk about Fight Club!

618
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,440
Third rule of Fight Club.

619
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,200
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

620
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,920
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

621
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,240
OnIy two guys to a fight.

622
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,120
Fifth rule.

623
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,760
One fight at a time, fell as.

624
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,240
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

625
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,080
Seventh rule.
Fights wiII go on as long as they have to.

626
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,320
And the eighth and final rule.

627
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,480
If this is your first night at Fight Club

628
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
you have to fight.

629
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
This kid from work, Ricky,

630
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,840
couldn't remember whether
you orderedpens with blue ink or black.

631
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,240
But Ricky was a god for ten minutes

632
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,520
when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.

633
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,440
Sometimes, all you could hear were
the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling.

634
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,960
Or the wet choke
when someone gas pedand sprayed...

635
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,000
Stop!

636
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,840
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

637
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,520
But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.

638
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,960
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

639
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,240
I wouldn't be talking to the same man.

640
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,520
Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.

641
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,440
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.

642
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,240
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.

643
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,120
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

644
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,200
- allve or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

645
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Hemingway. You?

646
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,720
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

647
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,800
We all started seeing things differently.

648
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,240
Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.

649
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,440
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,

650
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,440
trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiiger said they should.

651
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,560
Is that what a man looks like?

652
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,160
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

653
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Now, self-destruction...

654
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,240
Excuse me.

655
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,520
Fight Club wasn'tabout winning or losing.

656
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
It wasn't about words.

657
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,800
The hysterical shouting was in tongues

658
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,760
like at a Pentecostal Church.

659
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,120
- Is that it?
- Stop!

660
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,960
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.

661
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,880
But nothing mattered.

662
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,640
Cool.

663
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,400
After wards, we all felt saved.

664
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,480
Hey, man. How about next week?

665
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
How about next month?!

666
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
Everybody here in the middle.

667
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,680
New guy, you too.

668
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,440
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.

669
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,520
He fell down some stairs.

670
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
I fell down some stairs.

671
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,400
Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hairshort or trim your fingernails.

672
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,880
OK. Any historical figure.

673
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,760
I'd fight Gandhi.

674
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,120
Good answer.

675
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,360
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

676
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,920
Lincoln?

677
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,480
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

678
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Fuck!

679
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,040
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

680
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,080
Hello?

681
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,480
Where have you been the last eight weeks?

682
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,800
Marla?

683
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,680
- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.

684
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,640
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

685
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,800
We split'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?

686
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,600
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

687
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,040
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

688
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,880
I found a new one.

689
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,600
- Really?
- It's for men only.

690
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,200
Like the testicle thing?

691
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,760
Look, this is a bad time.

692
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,200
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

693
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,680
- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.

694
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,040
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

695
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,320
I took what was left of a bottle.

696
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
It might have been too much.

697
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,960
Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.

698
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,400
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

699
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,280
So you're staying in tonight, then?

700
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,080
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

701
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,480
Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?

702
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,200
Have you ever hearda death rattle before?

703
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,040
Tyler's door was closed. l'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.

704
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,800
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

705
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,040
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

706
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,320
What are you doing here?

707
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,920
What?

708
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,360
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

709
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,560
Fuck you!

710
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,800
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

711
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,800
Limber, though.

712
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,800
Silly cooze.

713
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,440
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

714
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,520
Guess who's on the other end?

715
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,720
I knew the story before he told me.

716
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,360
Have you everheard a death rattle before?

717
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,160
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

718
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,680
Or will it just be a death hairball?

719
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,800
Prepare to evacuate soul.

720
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,440
Ten,

721
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,200
nine,... eight...

722
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,440
How could Tyler, of all people,

723
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:40,240
think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?

724
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,880
Five,

725
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,520
four...

726
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
Hang on.

727
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,680
You got here fast.

728
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,160
Did I call you?

729
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,440
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

730
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,840
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

731
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,320
Oh, fuck!

732
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Somebody called the cops.

733
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,200
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

734
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,680
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

735
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,840
She has lost faith in herself.

736
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,640
- Miss Singer, let us heIp you!
- She's a monster!

737
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,680
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

738
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,400
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

739
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,120
If I fall a sleep,

740
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,360
I'm done for.

741
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,360
You're gonna have to keep me up

742
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
all night.

743
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,760
Un-fucking-believable.

744
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,920
He was obviously able to handle it.

745
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,560
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

746
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,640
- Never?
- No.

747
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,560
You're not into her, are you?

748
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
No! God, not at all.

749
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,240
I am Jack's raging bile duct.

750
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,200
Are you sure? You can tell me.

751
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,080
Believe me, I'm sure.

752
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,320
- Puta gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.

753
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,040
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

754
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,440
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

755
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,120
My God.

756
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,440
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

757
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,880
How could Tyler not go for that?

758
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,360
The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.

759
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,120
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

760
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,720
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

761
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,560
She invaded my support groups
and now my home.

762
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,640
Hey, hey. Sit down.

763
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,840
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

764
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,680
Why would I...

765
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,920
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

766
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,560
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

767
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,680
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

768
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,000
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

769
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,280
If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,

770
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,360
none of this would have happened.

771
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,880
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

772
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,600
I could have moved to another room.

773
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,360
On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.

774
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
But I didn't.

775
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,600
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

776
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,680
Wanna finish her off?

777
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,880
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

778
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,160
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

779
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,400
I became the calm little centre of the world.

780
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I was the Zen master.

781
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,840
I wrote little haiku poems.

782
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,680
I e-mailed them to everyone.

783
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,800
Is that your blood?

784
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Some of it, yeah.

785
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,040
You can't smoke in here.

786
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,120
Take the rest of the day off.

787
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,640
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

788
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,720
Get yourself together.

789
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,360
I gotrightin everyone's hostile face.

790
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,840
''Yes, these are bruises from fighting.''

791
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,920
''Yes, I'm comfortable with that.''

792
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,800
''I am enlightened.''

793
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,600
You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming world lypossessions,

794
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,640
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,

795
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,440
and you have to come home to this.

796
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,920
- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.

797
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,040
We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.

798
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,360
Yes.

799
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,160
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

800
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,800
They useda chisel to shatter the cylinder.

801
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,800
No, I wasn't aware ofthat.

802
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,800
I am Jack's coldsweat.

803
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,080
Does this sound strange to you?

804
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,880
Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.

805
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,920
- The dynamite
- Dynamite?

806
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

807
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,400
- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?

808
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,320
It means it was home-made.

809
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,480
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

810
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,880
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

811
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,920
- The gas was justa detonator.
- Who would go and do that?

812
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.

813
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,320
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property reallgned my perceptions.

814
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
Excuse me. Are you there?

815
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,280
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

816
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,640
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

817
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,920
- Enemies?
- Reject civilisation,

818
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
especially material possessions.

819
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,840
- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.

820
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,400
- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.

821
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,200
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

822
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,920
That condo was my life. OK?

823
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,400
I Ioved every stick offurniture in that place.

824
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,400
That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.

825
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,240
- It was me!
- l'd like to thank the Academy.

826
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,200
- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!

827
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,000
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

828
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,760
- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?

829
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,680
No. I may need to taIk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

830
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,040
- OK?
- OK.

831
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,080
Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.

832
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,120
My parents pulled this exactsame act
for years.

833
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,800
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

834
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,680
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

835
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,760
You... dance all night.

836
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,840
Then you throw it away.

837
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,600
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

838
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,480
What?

839
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,800
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

840
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,680
It was worth every penny.

841
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,760
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

842
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,760
Someone loved it intensely

843
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,800
for one day.

844
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,880
Then tossed it.

845
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Like a Christmas tree.

846
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,800
So special.

847
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,280
Then

848
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,080
bam!

849
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,160
It's on the side ofthe road.

850
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,720
Tinsel still clinging to it.

851
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,680
Like a sex crime victim.

852
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
Underwear inside out.

853
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,080
- Bound with electrical tape.
- well then, it suits you.

854
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,760
You can borrow it sometime.

855
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Get rid of her.

856
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,040
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

857
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,120
I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.

858
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,520
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

859
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,040
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

860
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,880
Gotta get off

861
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,200
Thanks. Bye.

862
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:17,000
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

863
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,400
Gonna get, need to get...

864
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,440
Gotta get...

865
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,920
You kids!

866
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,240
Why do you still waste time with her?

867
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,520
I'll say this about Marla.

868
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,800
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

869
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,160
And I'm not?

870
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,960
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

871
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,040
What are we doing tonight?

872
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,840
Tonight... we make soap.

873
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,840
Really?

874
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,680
To make soap, first we render fat.

875
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,920
The salt balance has to be just right

876
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,440
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

877
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,160
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

878
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,880
Pay dirt!

879
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,640
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

880
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,440
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

881
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,040
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

882
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,240
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

883
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
Like in Boy Scouts.

884
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,040
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

885
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,680
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

886
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,080
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

887
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,840
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

888
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,600
Yeah, with enough soap,
one couId bIow up just about anything.

889
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Tyler was full of use fulinformation.

890
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,560
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

891
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,640
- You know why?
- No.

892
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,960
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

893
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,120
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

894
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,520
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

895
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,200
Once it mixed with the meIted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

896
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,280
May I see your hand, please?

897
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,560
What is this?

898
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,120
This is a chemical burn.

899
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,560
It wiII hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

900
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,200
Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.

901
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,600
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

902
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,640
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

903
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,600
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

904
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,480
I triednot to think
of the wordsearing offlesh.

905
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,600
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

906
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,240
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

907
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,200
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

908
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,120
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

909
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,720
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

910
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,240
I am not!

911
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,200
Shut up!
Our fathers were our mode Is for God.

912
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,320
If our fathers balled,
what does that tell you about God?

913
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,320
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

914
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,320
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

915
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,840
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

916
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,760
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

917
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,240
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

918
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,640
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

919
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,120
- Or use vinegar to neutrallse the burn.
- Please let me up!

920
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
First, you have to give up.

921
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,880
First, you have to know, not fear,

922
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,840
know that some day, you're gonna die.

923
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,040
You don't know how this feels!

924
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,960
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

925
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,880
OK.

926
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,560
Congratulations.

927
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,440
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

928
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,280
Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.

929
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,280
God knows what they charged.

930
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,440
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

931
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,520
It was beautiful.

932
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,320
We were selling rich women
their own fatasses back to them.

933
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,280
He was wearing his yellow tie.

934
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,560
I didn't weara tie to work anymore.

935
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,120
''The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club.''

936
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,600
I'm haIf-a sleep again.
I must have left it in the copymachine.

937
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,080
''The second rule...'' Is this yours?

938
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,280
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

939
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,720
You find this. What would you do?

940
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,080
well, I gotta tell you,

941
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,680
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

942
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,920
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

943
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,320
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

944
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,160
and then stalk from office to office

945
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:53,080
with an Armallte AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

946
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,440
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

947
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,320
This might be someone
you've known for years.

948
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,400
Someone very, very close to you.

949
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,720
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.

950
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,680
And I used to be such a nice guy.

951
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,960
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

952
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,160
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

953
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,520
WiII you excuse me? I need to take this.

954
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,040
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

955
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,920
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

956
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,960
I don't know about this, Marla.

957
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,680
PIease.

958
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,600
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in herbook.

959
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,440
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

960
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,520
Where are they, exactly?

961
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,560
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

962
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,640
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

963
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,720
Thanks for the thought.

964
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,240
What happened to your hand?

965
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,400
Oh, nothing.

966
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,480
Right there?

967
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,040
- Feel anything?
- No.

968
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,080
well, make sure.

969
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,120
OK, I'm pretty sure.

970
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,120
You feel nothing?

971
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,400
No, nothing.

972
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,600
well, that's a relief. Thank you.

973
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,200
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favour.

974
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,280
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

975
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,720
- I couId check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

976
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,800
well, thanks, anyway.

977
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,840
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

978
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,040
See you... around.

979
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,800
Cornelius?

980
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,160
Cornelius!

981
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,840
It's me! Bob!

982
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,320
Hey, Bob.

983
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,600
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

984
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,560
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

985
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,000
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

986
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,720
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

987
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,120
well...

988
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,280
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

989
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,400
And the second rule is

990
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,680
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

991
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,080
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

992
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,160
Look at my face, Bob.

993
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,720
That's fucking... fucking great.

994
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,360
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

995
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,000
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

996
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,640
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

997
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,280
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

998
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,160
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds ofthings.

999
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,720
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

1000
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,040
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1001
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,240
He's a great man.

1002
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,880
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1003
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,840
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1004
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,920
Actually, you did.

1005
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Thank you for this.

1006
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1007
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Fight Club.

1008
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,720
This was mine and Tyler's gift.

1009
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:56,840
Our gift to the world.

1010
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,800
Our gift to the world.

1011
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,080
I Iook around, I Iook around,
I see a Iot of new faces.

1012
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,760
Shut up!

1013
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:10,520
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1014
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,400
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1015
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,480
I see all this potential.

1016
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,560
And I see it squandered.

1017
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,520
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1018
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,040
Waiting tables.

1019
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,120
Slaves with white collars.

1020
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,440
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1021
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,680
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1022
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,760
We're the middIe children of history.

1023
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
No purpose or place.

1024
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
We have no Great War.

1025
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,320
No Great Depression.

1026
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,280
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1027
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,920
Our great depression is our lives.

1028
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,600
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1029
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,200
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1030
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280
But we won't.

1031
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,720
We're slowly learning that fact.

1032
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,160
And we're very, very pissed off.

1033
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,800
Yeah!

1034
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,880
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1035
