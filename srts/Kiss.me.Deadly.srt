2
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,669
Ten minutes late.

3
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:49,840
You see anything?

4
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,775
There's a guy walking around inside.

5
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:55,948
It's one of his body guards.

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,689
Do you think
Kozlenko changed his mind?

7
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,621
No way.

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,326
With the amount of money
being waved in front of him,

9
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,827
trust me, he's comin' with us.

10
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,007
Get rid
of them.

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,304
He just gave the signal.

12
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,212
Copy that?

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,280
Didn't you hear me?

14
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,423
He gave the signal.

15
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:41,761
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,204
Thanks for the warning Jared.

17
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,943
Go get him.

18
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,272
Jesus.

19
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,067
Get outta there.

20
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:24,838
C'mon.

21
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:25,902
Let's go.

22
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:26,511
Marta.

23
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,011
There we go.

24
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,757
I got her, man. Go, go, go.
Get in. Drive. Go.

25
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:41,758
Jared, c'mon, get in.

26
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:43,691
Son of a bitch.

27
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:44,855
Who tipped them off? Let's go.

28
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:46,287
Let's go.

29
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,129
Go, go, go. Drive.

30
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,124
There he is.

31
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,002
Yale.

32
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,511
Sorry, I'm late.

33
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,746
They closed Ku'damn Strasse
to traffic.

34
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,078
Can you believe this?

35
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,218
How'd they find out he was defecting?

36
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,415
I don't know.

37
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,254
How is she?

38
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,854
How do you think?

39
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,021
Hm.

40
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,257
Is it confirmed that Kozlenko is dead?

41
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,033
And his body guard.

42
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,698
So what now?

43
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,296
Do you hear that noise out there?

44
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,669
That is the sound of a chapter
of history closing.

45
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,973
I do believe
we have just won the Cold War.

46
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,875
There's an entire city out
there tearing the wall down.

47
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,811
Gorbachev and the Ruskies
are now our new best friends.

48
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:16,048
Washington does
not want the boat rocked.

49
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,356
So what are you saying?
We're no longer relevant?

50
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,656
No, no, no.

51
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,018
There'll always be an enemy.

52
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:26,226
NIA thinks it's going to be the,
the Middle East. Oil.

53
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,499
Middle East?

54
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,296
Whoa. Wait, wait.

55
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,803
When you recruited me
you promised Paris, right?

56
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,271
Berlin, London. So now,
now what are you saying, Rihad?

57
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,607
You better drink up
while you still can, partner.

58
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,836
Saudi Arabia is a dry country.

59
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,209
Yeah,
maybe it's time for a career change.

60
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,197
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

61
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,596
We're not walking away

62
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,397
until our mission is done,

63
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,062
until the invader is out of Kuwait.

64
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,208
I, William Jefferson Clinton,

65
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,106
do solemnly swear

66
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,170
that I will faithfully execute

67
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,512
the office of President
of the United States.

68
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,916
And will to the best of my ability,

69
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,058
preserve, protect and defend
the constitution of the United States.

70
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,047
So help me God.

71
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,095
The President of the United States.

72
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,287
Our war on terror begins with
Al Qaeda, but it does not end there.

73
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,839
The coalition authority is intent on
moving forward as quickly as we can.

74
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,175
I love it.

75
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,980
Ah, good guys, keep it up.

76
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,019
Nice.

77
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,525
Two couples, uh,
let's get the feet uh,

78
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,228
right, yes, no, that's perfect.
Perfect.

79
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,521
Oh, very sexy guys.

80
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,157
Beautiful.

81
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,365
Let's switch it up,
switch it back up.

82
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,160
Good.

83
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,639
That's perfect.
Alright guys, together. Yes.

84
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,504
Great, great.

85
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,875
Beautiful. Beautiful.
Alright, really sexy now.

86
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,238
Let's feel the love.

87
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,304
Nice.

88
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,342
Why can't I meet a man like that?

89
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,046
Very hot, guys.

90
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:10,952
Yes.

91
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,256
Nice.

92
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,122
(speaks foreign language)

93
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,353
Yeah, goin' for a look.

94
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,341
Ciao.

95
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,344
Ciao.

96
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,008
Oh.

97
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,644
Oh, oh.

98
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,547
There's that little girl
that I love so much.

99
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,615
Hello, hello, hello.

100
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:48,755
Got everything you need?

101
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,121
- Right here.
- Alright,

102
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,530
let's drop by the apartment
and then we'll go wherever you want.

103
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,628
The pet shop?

104
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,565
Uh, well...

105
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,633
A puppy, please.

106
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,761
Uh, no, no, no.

107
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,964
Your mother would kill me.

108
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,622
You said anywhere.

109
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,272
Oh, how 'bout a movie.

110
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,469
I getta choose it?

111
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,308
Yes, whatever you want,
I'm yours for the weekend.

112
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,543
Yeah.

113
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,806
Do you want some gelato?

114
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,142
Mama never lets me
have any before dinner.

115
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,852
Well, I don't see her around here,
do you?

116
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,687
She'll get mad.

117
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,989
Only if she finds out.

118
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,154
Alright, now, here take this,
go over there, buy some gelato.

119
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,528
I'm not gonna tell your mom. Go.

120
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,109
Oh that's a lot more than we thought,
huh?

121
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,839
Yeah.

122
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,275
Alright eggo, put your uh,
backpack up in the room,

123
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,612
- we'll head off to the theater.
- Okay.

124
00:09:51,023 --> 00:10:02,992
(speaks in Italian)

125
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,165
Papa, why do you take pictures
of people in their underpants?

126
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,037
- Jacob.
- What's that, sweetie?

127
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:14,807
Why don't you take pictures
like these anymore?

128
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,713
Oh well, you know uh,

129
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:23,454
Daddy, I guess uh, got a little
tired tryin' to save the world

130
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,616
and decided to
make some money instead.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,250
(speaks in Italian)

132
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,287
Jacob, it's Marta,

133
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,798
l- I know its been a long time,
but I have to see you.

134
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,698
I'm coming to Milan by train from
Zurich, arriving at five-oh-nine.

135
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,300
Regardless
of what happened in the past,

136
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,604
you have to meet me.
I'll explain then.

137
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,268
Please be there.

138
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,115
Who was that?

139
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,007
There's someone at the door.

140
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,876
I will get rid of whoever it is.

141
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:34,758
Hey.

142
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,623
Hi, mama.

143
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,063
What are you doing here?

144
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:37,927
Are you okay, baby?

145
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,329
Oh no, she's fine, she's fine.

146
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,093
I just need you to watch her
for a couple hours.

147
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,194
I can't believe this.

148
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,293
Your timing is terrible.

149
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,362
I tried to call but your cell was off.

150
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,798
You said you weren't goin' anywhere.

151
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,940
I have plans.

152
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,369
Oh, I'm sorry.

153
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,047
Uh, something came up.

154
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,043
What?

155
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,274
I wouldn't do this if I had a choice.

156
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,878
And it won't take long.

157
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:00,611
Promise?

158
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,784
I swear.

159
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,314
And we'll still make the movie.

160
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,584
Okay.

161
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:05,991
You owe me.

162
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,586
Big time.

163
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:12,993
Come on, baby.

164
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,123
How was school today?

165
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:16,995
She's on the way out.

166
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,327
Marta, Marta.

167
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,066
Okay, you can
explain what's going on later.

168
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:58,865
Let's get outta here.

169
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,563
Let go.

170
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,273
What kind of trouble are you in?

171
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,872
Do I know you?

172
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,138
Do I know you?

173
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:08,979
Is this a joke?

174
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,244
Yes, you know me.
Y- you told me to meet you here.

175
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,145
Hey.

176
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,550
Why?

177
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,812
Look, just get in.

178
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,819
Prove you know me.

179
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,783
How the hell am I supposed to do that,
huh?

180
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,126
Uh, you got a fuckin' star tattoo
on your left hip.

181
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,230
(speaks in Italian)

182
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,361
Are you satisfied?

183
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,298
C'mon. C'mon, hurry.

184
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,063
(speaks in Italian)

185
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,831
(speaks in Italian)

186
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,523
So, what fuckin' happened man?

187
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,615
Just don't lose them.

188
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:04,867
Who the hell are you?

189
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,300
I'm Jacob.

190
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,739
Wait,
you- you don't remember calling me?

191
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:09,769
No.

192
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,972
You left me a message telling me
you were in trouble.

193
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,238
I don't even know why I'm here.

194
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,276
Hey, well that guy sure seemed
to know you were coming.

195
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,478
What do you think he wanted with me?

196
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,577
Oh my Jesus,
how the hell am I supposed to know?

197
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,986
I haven't seen you in years.

198
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,495
(speaks in Italian)

199
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,093
Why can't I remember?

200
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:38,729
I really wish I knew.

201
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,169
What's my name?

202
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,606
It's Marta.

203
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,044
Did you get hit in the head?
Have an accident or something?

204
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,474
I don't know.

205
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,612
Well you must have ID on you
or something with your name on it.

206
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,413
Look you were on a train,
got your passport?

207
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,991
All I have is this.

208
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,388
A key.

209
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,091
To what?

210
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,226
I don't know.

211
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,004
'Kay, let's uh, let's get inside.

212
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,971
How do we know each other?

213
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,175
We were operatives for the NIA.

214
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,476
NATO intelligence.

215
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:23,276
You went to Georgetown in Washington
DC where you were recruited.

216
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,378
I don't know
what you're talking about.

217
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,452
You were born in Russia,
small town north of Moscow.

218
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,582
Left with your mother
when you were still a child.

219
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,558
Why would I call you?

220
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,529
Sounds like you
got yourself into some trouble.

221
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,531
I'm gonna try and track down Yale
Erickson, who was our section chief.

222
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,502
Maybe he knows what's going on
and can help you.

223
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,667
Do you still work for them?

224
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,910
No, not for a long time.

225
00:16:59,218 --> 00:16:59,946
Do I?

226
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,852
I have no idea.

227
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,125
I need to uh, where's...

228
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,765
Yeah, it's uh, upstairs.

229
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,091
The one on the left.

230
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,851
I haven't heard that ring before.

231
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,411
It's a call coming in
on an old analog line.

232
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,654
Can you access it?

233
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,652
I think so.

234
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,994
Caller, please identify yourself.

235
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,637
This is Nighthawk.

236
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,406
Five-four-six-L-W-A.

237
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,009
Route me through to T-Rex.

238
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,743
Please hold.

239
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,003
Nighthawk's calling us.

240
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,778
Can you get me a location
and can you contact the director?

241
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,146
Nighthawk,
T-Rex is listed as an inactive file,

242
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,448
can you please state
your identifier again.

243
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,743
Yeah, Nighthawk.

244
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,047
Five-four-six-L-W-A.

245
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,787
You're also listed as inactive.

246
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,197
Please stand by.

247
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,212
Shit.

248
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,342
(unintelligible)

249
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,183
What?

250
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,353
Here.

251
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,268
C'mon, c'mon.

252
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,334
C'mon.

253
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,257
Nighthawk.

254
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,260
Hello?

255
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,665
Did you get a location on him?

256
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,742
Come in.

257
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,274
If that damned idiot didn't
fail in the first place,

258
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,977
we gotta clean house for another week.

259
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,012
Now we got those bastards firing
missiles, back & forth at each other,

260
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,421
like a pack of 9 year olds
in a summer camp.

261
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,023
Marcus,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

262
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,359
I'm going to see you on the 15th,
so you give my love to Catherine.

263
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,565
What the hell is this?

264
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,203
Communications received a call,

265
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,501
on an old analogue number
routed out of Milan.

266
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,366
546LWA

267
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,241
We haven't used indicative numbers
like that, since the 90's.

268
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,577
It's an inactive file, the caller
identified himself as Nighthawk.

269
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,716
We crosschecked the name, but it's
under a restricted access code.

270
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,484
I know who it is.

271
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,889
Jacob Keene, he's before your time.

272
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,028
Who's the point person in this?

273
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,492
His name is Henry, Aginon Henry.

274
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,329
He's an agent
in the Communications Department.

275
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,231
You transferred him
from the South American Office.

276
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,306
Right, right, right,
we recruited him out of Ml5.

277
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,436
That ambitious guy.

278
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,644
This is agent Henry.

279
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,539
Put me through to Nighthawk.

280
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,316
I'm afraid that's impossible, sir.

281
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:00,613
Why?

282
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,514
He hung up.

283
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,887
Call him back.

284
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,020
We've been trying,
but there's no answer.

285
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,750
What's his location?

286
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,195
He's still in Milan,
you want him apprehended, Sir?

287
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,759
Agent Henry, you're in communications,
not operations, is that correct?

288
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,001
Yes, sir, I know, I'm just...

289
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,903
I'm sending agent Davis down there.

290
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,900
She answers only to me, understood?

291
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,466
Yes, sir, understood.

292
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,810
What's the story on Keene.

293
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,475
It's complicated.

294
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,509
He was one of our best.

295
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,016
Was?

296
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,585
He's retired.

297
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,623
So why is a retired agent
calling in on a telephone line?

298
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,621
That's what I'd like to know.

299
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,025
I want you to go down there,
and I want you to track him.

300
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,839
I want to know where he goes,
what he does, who he sees.

301
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,039
But I don't want him stopped,
understood?

302
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,039
Completely.

303
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,667
And Davis...

304
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,412
This is on a need to know basis.

305
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,080
I don't want
the NIA turned upside down,

306
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:11,281
Just because of some ex-agent
on a cell phone, understood?

307
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,760
Hello, Jacob.

308
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,296
About time you showed up.

309
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,515
Okay, why are they after me?

310
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,484
What's the last thing you remember?

311
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:49,590
Whatta you mean?

312
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,085
Do you remember getting on the train?

313
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,231
No, just getting off.

314
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,493
How did they find us?

315
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,299
What?

316
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,332
If it's the agency,
they could've traced my phone.

317
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,407
So turn it off.

318
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,978
Nope. Got a better idea.

319
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,216
That guy seems to know you.

320
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,584
Smile at him.

321
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,896
I don't think I'm his type.

322
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,564
Wait here.

323
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,408
You know the Metro Club?

324
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,409
Yes.

325
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:49,850
One hour.

326
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,232
Marta, Marta.

327
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,332
Hey, where you going?

328
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,534
I'm going to the police.

329
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,194
No. No, no.

330
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,294
I didn't do anything.

331
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,134
You don't know that.
I gotta get you to Yale.

332
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,166
We can be tracked if we use credit
cards or ATM's so we need cash.

333
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:12,972
C'mon.

334
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,987
There's not much here.

335
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:34,696
Okay, in here.

336
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:49,846
Jesus.

337
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:52,841
What are you doing here?

338
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,476
I promised the proofs
to the client by Monday.

339
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,281
Remember?

340
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,115
You shot film.

341
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,677
I have to develop the negatives.

342
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,552
It's okay, Marta.

343
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,024
Who is she?

344
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,594
Old friend.

345
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,768
And where is Julia?

346
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,594
I need to borrow your car.

347
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:14,703
Where is yours?

348
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,741
Uh, left it at the train station.

349
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,405
I'll explain later.

350
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,340
How much cash do you have?

351
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,449
A little over two hundred euros.

352
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,348
Great, great, great.

353
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:28,844
Keys?

354
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,648
Let's go.

355
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,025
I can't believe this is happening.

356
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,530
It's been twenty years
since I've had to watch my back.

357
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,327
Where are we going now?

358
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,061
I'm taking you to Yale's chalet.
I'm betting that's where he is.

359
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,872
I'm gonna get you to him
and then I'm outta this.

360
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,264
Pronto.

361
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,163
Who is this?

362
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,428
Raphael.

363
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,161
Who is this?

364
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,181
Where is Jacob?

365
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:53,026
Let me talk to him.

366
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,000
This is not my phone.

367
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,198
I do not know who Jacob is.

368
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,505
Put him on.

369
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:04,646
Hello.

370
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,251
Where are they?

371
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:13,815
This is not my phone.

372
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,390
Of course it isn't.

373
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:16,950
Who is this?

374
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,557
You uh, you want to have some fun?

375
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,169
Sure.

376
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,237
I'm sure Daddy just got busy.

377
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:37,845
Decoy.

378
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,406
They could be a hundred kilometers
from here by now.

379
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,643
What're we gonna tell him?

380
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:43,985
Nothing.

381
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:49,721
Gone?

382
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:50,986
What do you mean gone?

383
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,663
We are not sure sir, we tracked
his cell phone as per Davis's orders.

384
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:57,797
He moved around Milan for several
hours and then the signal vanished.

385
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:58,766
He turned off his phone.

386
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,165
With all due respect, agent Davis,

387
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,228
even in shut down mode,

388
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,242
cell phone antenna continue
to transfer a microwave signal.

389
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,338
Maybe he realized
you were tracking him,

390
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,846
and he destroyed the goddamned thing.

391
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,187
Why did Keene retire?

392
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,157
He didn't.

393
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,363
He was retired.

394
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,799
Under what circumstances?

395
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,865
Jacob Keene caused this agency
a lot of embarrassment a long time ago.

396
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,707
And the agency
won't let it happen again.

397
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,073
So for all this time,

398
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,780
he makes a phone call,

399
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,573
wants to talk to you,

400
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:50,245
but then hangs up and does everything
he can to make sure we can't find him?

401
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,320
Why?

402
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,687
Something changed, and it scared him.

403
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,421
Or someone?

404
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,170
Bring me in it.

405
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,537
I already advised
all the border crossings,

406
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,012
all major railways out o f Milan.

407
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,917
Don't tell me the plans, Davis.

408
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:19,679
Execute it.

409
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,217
Find him, stop him.

410
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,890
I want Jacob Keene.

411
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:48,011
Oh, um, grazie.

412
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,774
(speaks in Italian)

413
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,247
Where are we?

414
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,645
Uh, we crossed the Swiss border
almost an hour ago.

415
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,019
How well do we know each other?

416
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,056
Did we just work together?

417
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,461
No, we were close.

418
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,660
How close?

419
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,395
What are you asking?

420
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,630
Were we lovers?

421
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:20,911
Marta...

422
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,216
I keep remembering things,
these moments of you and me.

423
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:27,816
It's complicated.

424
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,682
No, it's not.

425
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,748
Either we had sex or we didn't.

426
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:34,782
We did.

427
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,125
It was a long time ago, Marta.

428
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,359
What happened?

429
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,898
Things changed, we moved on.

430
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,804
I wish I knew
if anything you say is true.

431
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,289
(speaks in Italian)

432
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,398
Where's your boss?

433
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,127
Who are you?

434
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,126
Where did he and the woman go?

435
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,539
I don't know.

436
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,808
It's the weekend.
He could be anywhere.

437
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,139
I don't know where he is.

438
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,379
Why don't I believe you?

439
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,348
There's such a thing
as misplaced loyalty, my friend.

440
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,314
I've gotten information out of men
who were trained to ignore pain.

441
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,553
Where are they?

442
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,594
I don't know.

443
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,656
Car key's missing.

444
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,527
Did he take your car?

445
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,265
Kiss my ass.

446
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,200
Alright.

447
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,768
Jesus man,
tell him what he wants to know.

448
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,074
I know how to find him.

449
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,479
Car's got anti-theft tracking device.

450
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,023
It's under control.

451
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,190
Sure, bye.

452
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,403
Pretty boy,
you should be in the movies.

453
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,538
Got anything to say
to your boss before I kill ya?

454
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,264
Jacob.

455
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,568
Hi Jillian, how are you?

456
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,501
How am I?

457
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,368
Surprised, for one thing.

458
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,000
I thought you were
the delivery boy with my pills.

459
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,470
Oh my god.

460
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,708
I can't believe this.

461
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,010
Marta?

462
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,715
Oh, it's been so long.

463
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,982
Let me look at you.

464
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,283
You haven't changed a bit,
except your hair.

465
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,419
When did you change the color?

466
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,085
I don't know.

467
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,499
I need to see your husband.

468
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,700
Work had gotten to Yale.

469
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,335
Nothing was the same
after the wall came down.

470
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,174
The agency put him on medical leave.

471
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,212
This place was always his dream.

472
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,216
We thought being here would help
but um, nightmares continued.

473
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,888
Wake up in a cold sweat.

474
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,288
He was always secretive, but
I had a pretty good idea what he did.

475
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,998
You two and Jared were
the only people he ever brought home

476
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,488
and that was just toward the end.

477
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,965
One morning I woke up and he was gone.

478
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,836
I didn't know where he was for weeks.

479
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,396
And then I got a call
to meet him at St. Albans.

480
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,303
It's a small village
a couple of hours from here.

481
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,278
But he was different, withdrawn.

482
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,215
Said he wasn't coming home.

483
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,277
Told me to have a good life.

484
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,147
He is still alive.

485
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,686
As far as I know.

486
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,487
You never saw him again.

487
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,363
Life's strange, isn't it?

488
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,369
Whoever thought you two would be
together after what happened.

489
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,564
Why St. Albans?

490
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,740
There's a monastery nearby.

491
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,644
Yale went there.

492
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:52,615
He was cutting himself off
from everything, including me.

493
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,118
We never really talked about it,

494
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,384
but every time he went off
to god knows where,

495
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,826
we both knew he might never come back.

496
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,458
And when he did, he was
always looking over his shoulder.

497
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:11,958
He became detached, emotionless.

498
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,162
Maybe that's
why they called it the cold war.

499
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,042
In the house, both of you.

500
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,999
Who are you?

501
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,394
Jacob, let him go.

502
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,866
Hans,
from the chemist with my medication.

503
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,310
You're in trouble.

504
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,443
I thought you two were out.

505
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,540
I thought so too.

506
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,956
You were telling me the truth.
We were spies.

507
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,624
Were is the operative word.

508
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,538
I have a new life, one that I love.

509
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,306
Why was Jillian surprised
that we were together?

510
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,244
I don't know.

511
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,514
Your German was better than mine.

512
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,983
The brothers of St. Albans.

513
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,149
No admittance.
Please respect our privacy.

514
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:15,818
Alright, stay here.

515
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,221
I'm gonna check the place out.

516
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,963
For what?
It's a monastery for god's sake.

517
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,367
We were in the suspicion business.
Could be NIA safe house.

518
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,637
You're paranoid.

519
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,104
Remember don't trust anything.

520
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,138
Or anyone.

521
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,116
What are you doing here?

522
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:58,995
Yale, it's Jacob.

523
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,858
I know who it is.

524
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,133
Why are you here?

525
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,263
Marta's in some kind of trouble.

526
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:07,828
Gotta be NIA.

527
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,639
I haven't worked
for the NIA for years.

528
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,772
Who told you I was here?

529
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,207
Jillian. She misses you.

530
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,637
She said to tell you
the roses came up early this year.

531
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,475
The good brothers allow me
to stay here.

532
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,982
In return I do their gardening
and maintenance.

533
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,714
I think I may know
how you came to lose your memory.

534
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,160
Now think back.

535
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,722
Milan,
do you recall anything before Milan?

536
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,392
No.

537
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,863
Nothing at all?

538
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,593
I have flashes.

539
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,807
As if I'm in a dark room and somebody
turns on a light for a second.

540
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,242
Now don't be alarmed,
I just want to look for something.

541
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,023
Good.

542
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,791
What is it? I felt it before.

543
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,697
It's a small red mark.

544
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,062
It was made by an injection gun.

545
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,469
It's the reason
you've lost your memory.

546
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,341
She must have had some information
that they wanted.

547
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,871
If she had information they wanted,
why would they take her memory?

548
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,673
Back in the eighties

549
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,187
the lab boys at Langley came up
with the ultimate truth serum,

550
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,487
Trisodium nitrol,

551
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,020
code name Delphi.

552
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:39,830
Once injected,

553
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,800
the interrogates
could only tell the truth

554
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,367
about anything for thirty minutes.

555
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,432
But Delphi had a side effect.

556
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,034
The interrogates would start
to lose their memories.

557
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,543
In twenty-four hours they couldn't
even remember their own names.

558
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,646
Permanent irreversible amnesia.

559
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,262
No, I still have memories.

560
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,319
No, that's temporary.

561
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,432
That's just the last
few brain cells expiring.

562
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,536
Soon you will remember nothing.

563
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,107
I'm so sorry.

564
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,241
Delphi?

565
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,521
I've never heard of it.

566
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,854
Well, you didn't need to know.

567
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,390
It all goes back
to that Kozlenko matter.

568
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,465
If you had succeeded in bringing
him out in eighty-nine,

569
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,693
I was going to interrogate him.

570
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:00,601
What are you saying?

571
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,240
We were gonna drain his memory

572
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,399
and not give a damn
about what happened to him?

573
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:08,484
Believe me, I did much worse
when I worked for NIA.

574
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,010
Why do you think
I live here in a monastery?

575
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,082
What about the ten million dollars?

576
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,181
Well that was real enough.

577
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,029
The agency covered it's ass
just in case he checked.

578
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:21,991
Who's Kozlenko?

579
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,333
He was our last assignment.

580
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,105
You, me, a third agent named
Jared Clayton,

581
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,176
were gonna bring in a KGB operative,
Yuri Kozlenko.

582
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,881
First we were instructed to
go to a bank in Zurich,

583
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,087
where the agency had deposited
ten million US dollars

584
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,314
into a numbered account.

585
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:50,052
Pass code had twelve digits,
each of us was to enter four digits

586
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,618
and not tell the others
what they were.

587
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:56,064
I was told
that after Kozlenko was debriefed,

588
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,600
we'd give him the pass code

589
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:00,432
and he'd use the money
to start a new life in the west.

590
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,368
But it was a lie.

591
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,601
What about the money?

592
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,511
Well I suppose it was forgotten about.

593
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,980
When I left the agency it was uh,
still in the bank account in Zurich.

594
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,490
That's great, that's great.

595
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,491
Someone's after the money
and needs all the pin numbers.

596
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,296
Which means Jared
and I are in danger too.

597
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,794
Unless they got to him first.

598
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,834
C'mon, let's go.

599
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:42,640
C'mon.

600
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,608
Hurry.

601
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,732
They killed him.

602
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,966
They could've shot us both.

603
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,810
No, they need you alive to
get your part of the pass codes.

604
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,076
Look out.

605
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,349
You okay?

606
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,012
Yeah.

607
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,260
He's dead.

608
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:08,957
What're you gonna do?

609
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,288
Find out who he is?

610
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,628
I call the police.

611
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,546
Where's the other one?

612
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,745
Klaus Proppe.

613
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:31,988
Vigo DiPalma.

614
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:33,989
James Hollings.

615
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,116
How many names has he got?

616
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,821
It's probably none of the above.

617
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,062
He got Yale right between the eyes.

618
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,763
I bet he's an assassin for hire.

619
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,731
Hey, what are you doing?

620
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,670
Where are you going?

621
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,507
You drive.

622
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,689
Most of the calls are to one number.

623
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:21,401
Country code is forty-one, Switzerland.
City code's forty-four, Zurich.

624
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,601
What are you doing?

625
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,036
Oh, seeing what else is in here.

626
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,345
The truck driver was calling the
police. They'll be able to find us.

627
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,174
Got anything you wanna say
to your boss before I kill ya?

628
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,243
Fuck you.

629
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:43,890
Jacob.

630
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:48,396
Stop.

631
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,023
- We need to keep driving...
- Stop the damn car.

632
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:11,380
They killed Paolo.

633
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:22,256
They found his body
in the South Gardens of the monastery.

634
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,596
Yale.

635
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,199
You knew him?

636
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:31,964
He was NIA, and a friend.

637
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:37,040
It was a single bullet,
precision shot, a probe.

638
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:41,985
Who've seen this?

639
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,481
You, but just on the safe side,
I left a few things out.

640
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:50,826
Keene wasn't alone, the monks
reported seeing him with a woman.

641
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,525
They were able to give us
a very detailed description of her.

642
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,295
Apparently, it's been
a while since they've seen one.

643
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,665
So they paid close attention.

644
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:01,533
Martha.

645
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:02,702
Another agent?

646
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:04,838
A recruit.

647
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,344
She was brought in
for specific mission.

648
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,303
There was something else.

649
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,545
The location
of Keene's last cell phone signal

650
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,518
was an address in central Milan.

651
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,017
They found a body there last night.

652
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,049
20 year-old, his throat has been cut.

653
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,630
It doesn't necessarily mean
that Keene had anything to do with it.

654
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,696
He's ex-NIA.

655
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,828
His files are under
a restricted access code.

656
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,430
He was retired
for an embarrassing situation

657
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,167
and dead bodies are piling up
in his wake.

658
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,674
With all due respect, Sir.

659
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:45,704
I don't think you can
write this off as a coincidence.

660
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,548
With all due respect.

661
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,111
If you have something to say,
Davis, say it.

662
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,720
I thought I was sir.

663
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,924
Is there something
else I need to know about Keene?

664
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:01,960
Like?

665
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,169
Like how many people
did he kill for this agency?

666
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,768
One, and that was collateral damage.

667
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,449
Keene was part of a team,

668
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,112
whose first mission was aborted due
to circumstances beyond their control.

669
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,282
The target in question is killed.

670
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,090
Is that what these bodies are, sir?

671
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,885
More collateral damage?

672
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,529
I don't know what they are.

673
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,434
But is it is some kind of vendetta that
Keene has in mind it stops here now.

674
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,472
Find him.

675
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,439
Wherever the hell he is, find him.

676
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,074
Whack up new traces.

677
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,179
What do you want us to do to him,
when we find him?

678
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,151
You leave that to me.

679
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,674
They found his body
at the scene of a car crash

680
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,377
just outside
St. Albans carrying NIA documents.

681
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,817
He was discharged from the NIA six
months ago for psychiatric reasons.

682
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,057
So where'd he get the NIA papers?

683
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:43,294
Pronto.

684
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,094
You all right?

685
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:46,329
Yes.

686
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:47,866
Is Julia with you?

687
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:48,630
Yes.

688
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:49,663
Thank god.

689
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,241
Okay, where are you?

690
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,107
At home. Where the hell are you?

691
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,467
Better you don't know.

692
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,103
The police came here looking for you.

693
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,171
They found Paolo's body
at your studio.

694
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,510
Kyra, you know I thought
I could leave the past behind.

695
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,476
I know you did.

696
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,020
But why did you run?

697
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,682
It's complicated.

698
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,587
Look I need your help.

699
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,583
I have a Swiss phone number.

700
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,286
I need you to go on the computer,

701
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,421
use reverse directory,
see if you can get a, uh,

702
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:15,688
name and an address.

703
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,534
Kyra, it'll take you ten seconds.

704
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:20,730
Give me the number.

705
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,364
Got it.

706
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:55,762
Christian Lenk,

707
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,505
Twenty-one Zermatt Strasse,

708
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,772
Zurich, Zero-Five-W.

709
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:04,773
Great, okay, now you and Julia
need to go away for a couple days.

710
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,749
Go to the inn where she likes to
feed the ducks, you know where I mean.

711
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,115
You are creeping me out.

712
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,786
Promise you'll do it.

713
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,614
Not until you tell me
what's going on.

714
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,123
Okay look,
just get out of your apartment.

715
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,093
Turn off your cell phone. I'll
call you at the inn as soon as I can.

716
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,792
Go now.

717
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:20,521
Okay.

718
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,762
Tell Julia I love her.

719
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:24,997
Mama?

720
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:28,700
Right.

721
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,398
Who's Julia?

722
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,342
She's my daughter.

723
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:39,881
You were married.

724
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,618
Kyra's a friend of mine.

725
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,582
We both wanted a child.

726
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,464
I want you to tell me the truth.

727
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:01,968
About what?

728
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,874
You, me, what happened in Berlin.

729
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,468
I told you, we worked together.

730
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,476
Don't.

731
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,480
The memories are fading,
I can feel them disappearing.

732
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,245
I wanna know the truth
while it still matters. Please.

733
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,157
You were studying in Washington.

734
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:29,126
I was assigned to recruit you.

735
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,696
You seduced me.

736
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,166
It was part of the job.

737
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,569
Why me?

738
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:52,612
We knew you could help flip Kozlenko.

739
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,192
Who am I?

740
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:02,495
What is my name?

741
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,532
Kozlenko.

742
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,463
You're Marta Kozlenko.

743
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:09,733
He was my father?

744
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,101
I lured my father to his death?

745
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:16,475
It wasn't your fault.

746
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,742
He wanted it to look like a

747
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,446
kidnapping, not a defection.
Somehow the KGB got onto us.

748
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:41,537
We'll go to Zurich,
first thing in the morning.

749
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,499
I'm sorry.

750
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,010
You're sorry? For what?

751
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,017
For all of this.

752
00:55:56,052 --> 00:56:01,115
Maybe if I hadn't called you
or taken you out of your life, maybe...

753
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,351
It would've happened anyway.

754
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,258
Whoever's
after us needs my numbers too

755
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,695
and you weren't just part of the job.

756
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,959
I've always cared about you,
I always will.

757
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,706
Marta.

758
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:19,998
Alright we have to get outta here.

759
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,362
What's wrong?

760
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,736
Police are downstairs.
We made the paper.

761
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,115
(speaking German)

762
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,058
(speaking German)

763
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,774
You speak English?

764
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,680
We need you to drive us to Zurich.

765
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,407
We're not gonna hurt you.

766
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:09,945
But my deliveries. I have customers.

767
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,987
Today we're you're only customers.

768
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,796
Don't even think about it.

769
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,798
Thank you, Jann. I hope we didn't
cause you too much trouble.

770
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:02,730
Appreciate it if you can, uh,

771
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:04,830
wait a couple hours
before callin' the police.

772
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:06,540
And you were right.

773
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,375
The strudel was excellent.

774
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,348
Damn, we should have grabbed
a couple of those crescents to go.

775
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,284
Oh well.

776
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,950
Jacob, what happened to me
after my father died?

777
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,325
Honestly, I don't know.

778
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,523
You hated me.

779
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,625
You left Berlin
and I left the business.

780
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,760
And we never spoke again?

781
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,030
Oh, I'd phone,
you wouldn't take my calls.

782
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,037
I have no idea
where you went or what you did.

783
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,873
Started a new life,
thought I could leave the past behind.

784
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:41,832
So much for that, huh?

785
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,981
We don't just ring the doorbell,
right?

786
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:51,346
Look, why don't you, uh, stay here.
I'm gonna go look around.

787
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:34,388
(speaking German)

788
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,291
Marta.

789
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,234
Don't move.

790
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,317
Hi.

791
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:41,157
Hi.

792
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:42,688
How did you?

793
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,232
Dog seems to know you.

794
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:51,669
Maybe.

795
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,039
Do I live here?

796
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:04,983
It doesn't look familiar.

797
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,001
Huh, no labels.

798
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,868
Well, someone's got expensive taste.

799
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,054
Men's clothing, no women's.
I must not live here.

800
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,826
Gotta be something
to identify whoever does.

801
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,802
You definitely know
whoever lives here.

802
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,133
Okay, what's going on Marta?

803
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,013
Know what I think?

804
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,412
I think you set me up.

805
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,844
I think this amnesia is bullshit.

806
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,185
No, no.

807
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:51,584
Oh, fuck me.

808
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,720
What? You're gonna tell me,
you don't know who this is?

809
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:55,159
Who is it?

810
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,721
It's Jared, damn you.

811
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:00,035
Paolo and Yale are dead, Marta. Why?

812
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,236
I don't know.

813
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,605
Alright, I don't remember anything,
I swear.

814
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,265
Is Jared a victim too
or is he in on this?

815
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,705
Yeah, um, I'm getting out of here.

816
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,067
What're you gonna do?

817
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:18,683
It's Kyra.

818
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,419
I told you
to turn off your cell phone.

819
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,123
What have you gotten us into?

820
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:24,987
Why are you calling here?

821
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,026
Because I told her to.

822
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,691
You know she was packing
to leave when we got here.

823
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,997
Oh, I haven't spoken
to you since Berlin, partner.

824
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,005
What do you want, Jared?

825
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,040
Oh, come on. You're a smart guy.

826
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,333
You've spoken to Marta,
you found my place.

827
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,011
You must have figured it out by now.

828
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:44,845
Numbers to the Swiss bank account.

829
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,474
There ya go.

830
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,880
This can't be agency sanctioned.

831
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,279
Yeah well,
let's call it my retirement plan.

832
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,878
You killed Yale.

833
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:53,722
And Paolo.

834
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,047
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.

835
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,088
You're outta luck asshole.
I forgot 'em years ago.

836
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,054
Really?

837
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:00,958
Oh you did?

838
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:02,428
I don't think so.

839
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,201
- Papa, please help us.
- Please...

840
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,099
Mama?

841
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,531
You know it's gonna take me
a little while to get to Zurich

842
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,268
so make yourselves at home.

843
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,137
There's a bottle
of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.

844
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,474
You kids knock yourselves out.

845
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,008
I'll see you at the bank at four.

846
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,240
You remember where that is.

847
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,346
'Kay, we're not staying here.

848
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:28,580
And I am not letting you out
of my sight.

849
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,027
Get her ready to go.

850
01:05:31,062 --> 01:05:31,686
Hurray.

851
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,453
No, no.

852
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,324
Please.

853
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,389
- Please.
- Listen. Listen to me. Listen.

854
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,334
You say nothing about this, and
your daughter will be home tonight.

855
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,868
Talk to anyone and she's dead.

856
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:44,866
You understand what I'm saying.

857
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,709
Look, l- I don't blame you
for not trusting me.

858
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,281
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

859
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,410
the Marta I knew wouldn't be
involved in anything like this.

860
01:05:58,387 --> 01:05:59,615
People don't change that much.

861
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,349
Jacob, where are we going now?

862
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,985
I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to get her back.

863
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,459
If I'm gonna save her,
I'll need your help.

864
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:07,188
Can I trust you?

865
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:29,484
C'mon.

866
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,007
That's it.

867
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,793
Shit, c'mon.

868
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:27,604
Jared.

869
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,770
How'd you recognize me?

870
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,081
From pictures.

871
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,379
Of us together.

872
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:36,715
Where's Jacob?

873
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,317
Take me to Julia, and when
I know she's okay, I'll call him.

874
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:46,022
What would you say if I told you,
uh she was still in Italy?

875
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,824
Then you don't get your money.

876
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:53,162
Good old Jacob, huh?

877
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,634
I shoulda known
he'd keep the game interesting.

878
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,335
Where is he?

879
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,001
Is he looking at us now?

880
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:00,707
Is the girl in Italy?

881
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,846
No, she's here in Zurich.

882
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,544
I have a taxi waiting.

883
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,287
How long was I with you?

884
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:19,520
Not long.

885
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,421
You were setting me up.

886
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:22,963
To get the money.

887
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,363
(speaking German)

888
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,562
How did we get together?

889
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,036
Does it really matter?

890
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:30,968
Yes.

891
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:32,974
I tracked you down.

892
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,668
I bumped into you in front
of your apartment in Paris.

893
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,144
Pretended it was just,
uh, by chance.

894
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,376
We had a really good time
in St. Tropez.

895
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,145
You stole my life.

896
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:49,452
Look, if it's any consolation,
it really wasn't much of a life.

897
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,253
You didn't seem very happy.

898
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,861
Oh. Blame yourself.

899
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:00,032
I mean, I tried to cut you in, but
you wouldn't give me your pass code,

900
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,570
so I mean, I had to use the drug.

901
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:04,937
How did I get away from you?

902
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:06,806
I guess I'm getting old.

903
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:07,939
Sloppy.

904
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,102
I forgot how physical you could be.

905
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,412
You ran off to tell Jacob.

906
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:16,811
(speaking German)

907
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:09,035
Please.

908
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,801
Oh yeah, I'd be afraid too.

909
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,704
Why are you helping him?

910
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,139
Call it instinct.

911
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,474
You couldn't take that away from me.

912
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,594
Uh, do you wanna see the girl or not?

913
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,136
This way.

914
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:18,804
Stay.

915
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:23,574
What happened?

916
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:25,307
It's under control, thank you.

917
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:27,613
Julia, I'm Marta.

918
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:28,775
I'm a friend of your father's.

919
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:29,781
Where is he?

920
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,176
He's waiting for you.

921
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:32,276
Where?

922
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:33,343
Yes, okay. Thank you.

923
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,790
You've seen the girl,
now let's make this thing happen.

924
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,623
Jacob wants me to stay with her.

925
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,029
He doesn't care about the money,
he wants his daughter.

926
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,663
And he wants to remember who she is.
Where's the injection gun?

927
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,629
Oh yes, this is vintage Jacob.

928
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,568
Always loves a chess game.

929
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:51,164
And always three moves ahead.

930
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:52,568
I have it.

931
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,305
It stays here.

932
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:57,869
It's the only way
he'll give you his numbers.

933
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,619
You'll meet him
at Fraumunster Church.

934
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,089
And what stops me
from killing you right now?

935
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,222
Because you're a smart man.

936
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:13,117
You're gonna meet Jacob,

937
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,622
he'll call, you'll
have us released and after that,

938
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,862
you'll have the numbers and Jacob.

939
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:23,427
You may have lost your memory Marta,
but, uh, you still have balls.

940
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,832
If you haven't heard
from me in an hour,

941
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,408
kill them both.

942
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,655
She really needs to
go to the bathroom.

943
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,256
Do I look like I fucking care?

944
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:52,889
Just tell me where it is.

945
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:55,161
Fuck.

946
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,390
The end of the corridor.

947
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:12,571
(speaking German)

948
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:13,979
(speaking German)

949
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:15,640
Oh, shit.

950
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:16,445
I'll walk.

951
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:20,684
Here.

952
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:21,990
(speaking German)

953
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,420
Hey.

954
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,328
Get the fuck off.

955
01:16:59,047 --> 01:16:59,411
You alright?

956
01:16:59,481 --> 01:16:59,913
Yeah.

957
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:00,573
Okay.

958
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:01,047
Where is she?

959
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:01,775
This way.

960
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:10,686
Hey baby. Hi. Hey. Hey. You okay?

961
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:13,057
Yeah? You're okay. Okay.
Everything's gonna be alright.

962
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,291
Oh god, what would I do without you?

963
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,394
C'mon, daddy's got you.

964
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,527
Let's get outta Zurich.

965
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:22,598
Not yet.

966
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,263
We got one more thing to do.

967
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:40,451
Damn it.

968
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:49,723
Jacob?

969
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:51,761
Jared.

970
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:53,700
What's goin' on, buddy?

971
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:55,032
Where are you?

972
01:17:58,807 --> 01:17:59,865
Turn around.

973
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:07,941
This isn't working out
the way you wanted, is it?

974
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,712
Let's go in the church.

975
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,181
You need to repent.

976
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:22,830
Keep going.

977
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:35,741
You probably don't go to church much,
do you?

978
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:36,971
What the fuck is this all about?

979
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,810
How about Paolo?

980
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:40,506
Huh?

981
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:41,812
How 'bout Yale?

982
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:43,683
Collateral damage.

983
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:45,782
Acceptable losses

984
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:48,550
when you consider that with
interest there's over twenty million

985
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,056
in Kozlenko's account right now.

986
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,988
Aw, c'mon partner, just think
what we could do with that money.

987
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,597
You been planning this
for a long time, huh?

988
01:18:59,101 --> 01:18:59,760
Nah.

989
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:01,733
You know, you got out when you should.

990
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,068
I stayed too long.

991
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,300
I got bounced around, passed over.

992
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,741
You know, the last time
I really enjoyed the game was Berlin.

993
01:19:09,344 --> 01:19:10,811
Right before the wall came down.

994
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,139
So, you started thinking about
the money.

995
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,372
Yeah, checked some records.

996
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:16,445
It was forgotten about.

997
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:19,783
I mean, c'mon,
it's all sitting there, right there.

998
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:24,652
I think I'm gonna follow your
example, bro, and not share.

999
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:30,431
You are gonna tell me your code
numbers and Marta's code numbers.

1000
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:35,198
Oh. Oh I know you way too well,
partner.

1001
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,759
Yeah?

1002
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:36,428
Yeah.

1003
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:37,767
You're not gonna shoot me.

1004
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,529
You couldn't pull the trigger.

1005
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:42,975
You're right.

1006
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,018
The only thing I'm gonna regret
is that you won't remember

1007
01:19:50,053 --> 01:19:51,542
what an asshole you've become.

1008
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,856
I wonder what two shots would do?

1009
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,598
So, how did it go?

1010
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,299
Couldn't have been smoother.

1011
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,568
They didn't ask any questions?

1012
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:18,674
Transferred all the funds to
a new account in the Cayman Islands.

1013
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:26,047
Oh baby.

1014
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,144
He was found two weeks ago.

1015
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,846
Patrolman saw him wandering
on Bahnhofstrasse.

1016
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,978
Dazed, confused.

1017
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,743
Ran his prints and uh,

1018
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,684
found that he worked for your group,
NATO Intelligence.

1019
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,216
Thought you could help us.

1020
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:06,555
He was stationed in Zurich.

1021
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:08,387
Shuffling papers.

1022
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:09,794
Hm.

1023
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,457
What'd the doctor's say?

1024
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:12,795
No.

1025
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,835
He's catatonic.

1026
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:17,799
Appears to be awake
but he's uh, not responsive.

1027
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,205
There's been no change
in the two weeks.

1028
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:23,771
I think he's hopeless.

1029
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:29,775
So whatever he once knew
will die with him.

1030
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:42,893
Nothing?

1031
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:45,532
No sir, we had a tracer
put on Keene's passport.

1032
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:46,856
The woman as well.

1033
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:48,269
But they vanished.

1034
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:50,705
And Jared Clayton.

1035
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,574
They are moving him
into a nursing home, outside of Staad.

1036
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:55,604
On NIA pension of course.

1037
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:57,375
Of course.

1038
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:04,211
All right,
we tie up the usual loose ends.

1039
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:08,354
Release statements
about terrorist cells to cover up.

1040
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,852
And tomorrow morning,
we'll be back to business as usual.

1041
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:14,154
Good night, agent Henry.

1042
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,628
Sir, there's just one more thing.

1043
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:17,796
It's very late.

1044
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,390
It's about the Kozlenko affair.

1045
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:23,500
What about it?

1046
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:27,731
I did some research, and as you know
the NIA keeps excellent records.

1047
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,703
Kozlenko's require
a Class A security clearance.

1048
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,412
And in 1988 there were only two people,

1049
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,346
other than the operatives themselves

1050
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,681
with that kind of clearance
on that specific project.

1051
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:40,021
One of them Yale, is dead.

1052
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,307
Oh god, what the hell is this?

1053
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,502
You are the one
that set up agent Kozlenko.

1054
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,440
You told the Stazi
about the defection.

1055
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,106
And you helped set the trap
that killed him.

1056
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:09,881
You have no proof.

1057
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,986
Actually sir, I do, the money.

1058
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,848
The ten million dollars marked
for Kozlenko.

1059
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:18,025
Once a year the bank needs
a signature to renew the account.

1060
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,157
I checked it out.

1061
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,522
It was your signature, sir.

1062
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:21,324
The only thing

1063
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,990
I can't figure out is whether
Jared Clayton was working for you.

1064
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:25,258
Or you were working for him?

1065
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:30,328
I knew you were ambitious, Henry.

1066
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,006
I just didn't know how ambitious.

1067
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,307
Security is on its way up to you, sir.

1068
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,079
You might want to call your lawyer.

1069
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,742
I'm not going to be calling anybody.

1070
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:57,462
Sir, you were saying?

1071
01:23:59,200 --> 01:23:59,996
Sounds good.

1072
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:02,035
I'll release the statement
in the morning.

1073
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,803
You should get some sleep,
agent Davis.

1074
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:05,795
You sound tired.

1075
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,205
It's been a long week.

1076
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:27,286
Yeah, yeah, I - I can hear him.

1077
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:28,994
Uh, yapping in the background.

1078
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:31,091
Is he house broken yet?

1079
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:32,663
Mm, sorta.

1080
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,264
Mama's not really happy.
When are you coming back?

1081
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:38,568
Yeah, I'm- I'm not sure yet, angel.

1082
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:40,238
As soon as I can.

1083
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,375
Listen, I gotta go.

1084
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,641
I will uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1085
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:48,709
Bye, I love you papa.

1086
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,076
I love you too, Julia.

1087
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,319
You two,
uh, takin' off for the airport?

1088
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,088
Yeah.

1089
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,227
You sure
you're doin' the right thing?

1090
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,590
I mean, you know,
you just met the guy.

1091
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,525
Could be he's only uh,
after your money.

1092
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,101
Well, that's okay.
I'm only after his body.

1093
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,101
So, how much longer
are you planning on staying?

1094
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:16,476
I gotta think through some things.

1095
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:19,040
Gonna take a while longer.

1096
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,543
Don't forget about me.

1097
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:17,963
Jacob Keane?

1098
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:20,400
I'm Agent Henry.

1099
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,238
I'm with the agency
you used to work for.

1100
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:25,972
What agency?

1101
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:28,972
We're very impressed
with what you did.

1102
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,653
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1103
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:37,321
The director would like to know

1104
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:39,986
if you'd entertain
the notion of taking on a certain

1105
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:41,988
freelance assignment.

1106
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:46,327
And why would I wanna do that?

1107
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:49,259
'Cause you're a rich man now.

1108
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,280
I already was a rich man,
Agent Henry.

1109
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,083
You gave the money to Marta.

1110
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,978
After everything, don't you think
it's the least she deserves?

1111
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:18,792
You on duty right now?

1112
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:22,126
Not officially.

1113
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,600
You like rum?

1114
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:43,980
END
