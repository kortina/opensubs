2
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:58,367
This is the story of a man
marked by an image from his childhood.

3
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,246
The violent scene that upset him,

4
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,917
and whose meaning
he was to grasp only years later,

5
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,961
happened on the observation deck
at Orly Airport

6
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,256
a few years
before the outbreak of World War III.

7
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,689
Parents take their children to Orly
on Sunday to watch the departing planes.

8
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,317
Of this particular Sunday,

9
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,027
the child whose story
we're about to tell

10
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,030
would long remember the frozen sun,

11
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,783
the setting at the end of the deck,

12
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,911
and a woman's face.

13
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,582
Nothing distinguishes memories
from ordinary moments.

14
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,254
Only later do they become memorable
by the scars they leave.

15
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,299
That face was to be
the only image from peacetime

16
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,885
to survive the war.

17
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,721
He often wondered
if he'd really seen it

18
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,391
or just invented
that tender moment

19
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,978
to counter the moments
of madness to follow.

20
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,521
The sudden roar,

21
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,939
the woman's gesture,

22
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,899
the crumpling body,

23
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,945
and the cries of the crowd,
blurred by fear.

24
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,243
Later he realized
that he'd seen a man die.

25
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,956
Soon afterwards,
Paris was destroyed.

26
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,739
Many died.

27
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,325
Some considered themselves victors.

28
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,577
Others were taken prisoner.

29
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,915
The survivors settled in underground
passages beneath Chaillot.

30
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,172
Aboveground, Paris,
like most of the world,

31
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,510
was uninhabitable,
riddled with radioactivity.

32
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,138
The victors stood guard
over a kingdom of rats.

33
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,853
Prisoners were subjected
to experiments

34
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,524
apparently of great concern
to those who conducted them.

35
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:53,060
The outcome was disappointment
for the experimenters,

36
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,063
and for the subjects,
either death

37
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,565
or madness.

38
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:43,319
One day they came to select a new
guinea pig from among the prisoners.

39
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,572
He was the man whose story
we are now telling.

40
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,813
He was frightened.

41
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,611
He had heard
about the head experimenter

42
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,572
and was prepared
to face the mad scientist

43
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,408
or Dr. Frankenstein.

44
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,494
Instead, he found
a reasonable man

45
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:38,040
who calmly explained
that the human race was doomed.

46
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,167
Space was out of the question.

47
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:45,089
The only hope for survival
lay in time.

48
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,802
A loophole in time
might make it possible

49
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:54,181
to reach food, medicine, energy.

50
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,852
This was the aim of the experiments:

51
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,396
to send emissaries into time

52
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,274
to summon past and future
to the rescue of the present.

53
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,278
But the human mind recoiled.

54
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,363
To wake up in another time

55
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,534
was to be born again, as an adult.

56
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,661
The shock was too great.

57
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:20,666
After sending lifeless or unconscious
bodies into different time zones,

58
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:26,088
the inventors now focused on men
with powerful mental images.

59
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,550
If they could conceive of
or dream of another time,

60
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,887
perhaps they would be able
to enter into it.

61
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,684
The camp police spied
even on dreams.

62
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,061
This man was selected

63
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,982
due to his fixation
on an image from his past.

64
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:39,787
First, the present and all its supports
must be stripped away.

65
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,041
They start again.

66
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,661
The subject doesn't die

67
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,496
or go mad.

68
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,998
He suffers.

69
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,333
They continue.

70
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,875
On the tenth day,

71
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,545
images begin to well up
like confessions.

72
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,465
A peacetime morning.

73
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,387
A peacetime bedroom.
A real bedroom.

74
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,516
Real children.

75
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,646
Real birds.

76
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,026
Real cats.

77
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,906
Real graves.

78
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,245
On the 16th day,
he's on the observation deck.

79
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,081
It's empty.

80
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,628
Sometimes he finds
a day of happiness,

81
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,671
but it's a different one.

82
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:02,346
A happy face,
but it's a different one.

83
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,102
Ruins.

84
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,940
A girl who could be
the one he seeks.

85
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,277
He crosses her path
on the observation deck.

86
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,950
She smiles at him from a car.

87
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,288
Other images pour out
and mix

88
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,291
in a museum
that is perhaps his memory.

89
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,086
On the 30th day,
the meeting takes place.

90
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,468
This time he's sure
he recognizes her.

91
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,720
In fact, it's the only thing
he's sure of

92
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,765
in this timeless world
that amazes him with its riches.

93
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,117
All around him
are astonishing materials:

94
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,037
glass, plastic,

95
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,206
terry cloth.

96
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,959
When he shakes off his fascination,

97
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,170
the woman has disappeared.

98
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,385
The experimenters tighten their control

99
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,055
and send him back on the trail.

100
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,725
Time rolls back again.
The moment returns.

101
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,444
This time he's close to her
and speaks to her.

102
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,905
She greets him without surprise.

103
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,076
They have no memories, no plans.

104
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,621
Time takes shape
painlessly around them.

105
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,582
Their sole landmarks
are the taste of the moment

106
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,585
and the markings on the walls.

107
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,182
Later they're in a garden.

108
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,269
Ηe remembers that there were gardens.

109
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,926
She asks him about his necklace,

110
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:32,097
the combat necklace he wore at the start
of the war that is to break out someday.

111
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,808
He makes up an explanation.

112
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,400
They stop before a redwood trunk
marked with historical dates.

113
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,486
She mentions a foreign name
he doesn't understand.

114
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:58,999
As in a dream, he points beyond
the tree trunk and hears himself say,

115
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,335
"That's where I come from"...

116
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:07,090
and falls back, exhausted.

117
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,347
Then another wave of time lifts him up.

118
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,266
They probably give him another shot.

119
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,196
Now she lies sleeping in the sun.

120
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,832
He thinks that,
in the time it took him

121
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,169
to return to her world, she died.

122
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,721
She wakes up.
Ηe speaks to her again.

123
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,016
The truth being
too fantastic to be believed,

124
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,353
he mentions only the essentials:
a distant land,

125
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,855
a long way to travel.

126
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,650
She listens and doesn't laugh.

127
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,681
Is it the same day?

128
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,683
Ηe no longer knows.

129
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,978
They'll take countless walks
like this one,

130
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,647
and an unspoken trust
will grow between them,

131
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,608
trust in its purest form.

132
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:53,113
No memories, no plans,
until the moment he senses

133
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,158
a barrier ahead.

134
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,463
Thus the first set of experiments
came to an end.

135
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,511
It was the starting point
for a series of tests

136
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,805
in which he'd meet her
at different times.

137
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,356
He meets her a few times
before their markings on the walls.

138
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,739
She welcomes him simply.

139
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,200
She calls him her ghost.

140
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,830
One day she seems frightened.

141
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,419
One day she leans over him.

142
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,509
He never knows
whether he moves toward her

143
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,135
or is pushed,

144
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,889
whether he's made it all up
or is only dreaming.

145
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,744
Around the 50th day,

146
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,790
they meet in a museum
filled with ageless animals.

147
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,446
Now their aim is perfect.

148
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,282
They can aim him at a given moment,

149
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,410
and he can stay there
and move around at ease.

150
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,298
She too seems to have adjusted.

151
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,936
She accepts the ways of this visitor
as a natural phenomenon,

152
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:39,107
how he comes and goes,
exists, talks,

153
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,277
laughs with her, falls silent,
listens to her,

154
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,237
and then vanishes.

155
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,587
Once back in the laboratory,

156
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,965
he sensed that something
had changed.

157
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,635
The camp director was there.

158
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:52,138
From what was said around him,

159
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,600
he gathered that after the success
of the experiments in the past,

160
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:59,145
they now meant
to launch him into the future.

161
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,148
His excitement
made him forget for a moment

162
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:06,319
that the meeting in the museum
was their last.

163
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,162
The future was better armored
than the past.

164
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,793
After several
even more grueling attempts,

165
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,088
he eventually caught
some waves of the world to come.

166
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,718
He crossed a planet transformed...

167
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,347
with Paris rebuilt...

168
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:37,225
10,000 incomprehensible streets.

169
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,607
Others were waiting for him.

170
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,530
It was a brief encounter.

171
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:54,659
They clearly refused
this slag from another time.

172
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,831
He recited his lesson:

173
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,083
Since humanity had survived,

174
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:07,213
it couldn't refuse to its own past
the means of its own survival.

175
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,680
This sophism was taken
for fate in disguise.

176
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,777
They gave him a power unit

177
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:33,448
strong enough to set
all human industry in motion again.

178
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,035
Then the gates of the future
closed once again.

179
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,795
Shortly after his return,

180
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,673
he was transferred
to another part of the camp.

181
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,093
He knew his jailers
would not spare him.

182
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,096
He'd been a tool in their hands.

183
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:01,434
His childhood image
had served as bait to train him.

184
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,729
He'd lived up to their expectations
and played his part.

185
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,398
Now he only waited to be executed,

186
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:12,362
with the memory of a twice-lived
moment in time somewhere inside him.

187
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:18,284
Deep in this limbo, he received word
from the people of the future.

188
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,704
They too could travel through time,

189
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,374
and more easily.

190
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,918
There they were,

191
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,964
ready to accept him
as one of their own.

192
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,802
But he had a different request.

193
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,097
Rather than that pacified future,

194
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:43,268
he asked to be returned
to the world of his childhood

195
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,980
and that woman
who might be waiting for him.

196
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,113
Once again
on the observation deck at Orly...

197
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,076
on this warm Sunday before the war
where he could now stay,

198
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,996
he thought confusedly
how the child he'd been

199
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,166
must be there too,
watching the planes.

200
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,961
But first he sought out
a woman's face

201
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,672
at the end of the deck.

202
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,193
He ran toward her.

203
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,280
And when he recognized the man
who'd trailed him from the camp,

204
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,034
he realized there was
no escape from time,

205
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,121
and that that moment
he'd been granted to see as a child,

206
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,291
and that had obsessed him
forever after...

207
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,754
was the moment of his own death.

208
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:59,769
