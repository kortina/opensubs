I think being clear with your
objectives is more important

660

than trying to
present your ideas

LOU: All sorts of things,
actually.

I'm on my computer
all day.

669
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,482
I haven't had what you'd call
much of a formal education,

670
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,166
but you can find most anything
if you look hard enough.

671
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,685
Last year, I took an online
business course, for example.

672
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,764
And I learned that you have
to have a business plan

673
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,649
before starting a business.

674
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,927
And that why you
pursue something

675
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,287
is equally as important
as what you pursue.

676
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,491
The site advised you

677
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,846
to answer
the following question

678
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,287
before you decide where
to focus your abilities.

679
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,964
The question was

680
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,690
"What do I love to do?"

681
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,611
The site suggested
making a list

682
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,125
of your strengths
and weaknesses.

683
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,361
What am I good at?

684
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,602
What am I not good at?

685
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,600
Maybe I want to strengthen
and develop knowledge

686
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,971
about the things
I'm already good at.

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,088

that television news

691

something I love

692

784
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,881
Do you wanna go with me?

785
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,320
I think we could
have fun together.

786
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,124
Thanks, but I'm busy.

787
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,281
Saturday is your
night off, isn't it?

788
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,283
I have a rule, Lou.

789
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,488
I don't date
people I work with.

790
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,289
And I'm twice your age.

791
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,526
I like older women.

792
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,686
Besides,
I don't work with you.

793
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,807
You're someone I sell to.

794
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,848
And I don't
wanna fuck that up.

795
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,608
What if by saying no,
you fuck it up?

796
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,890
MAN: All right, 10 seconds
to go and back on.

797
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,405
Is that what you're saying?

798
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,731
I didn't say that.
(LAUGHING)

799
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,202
MAN: Eight, seven,
six, five...

800
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,169
Well, I don't know
what to say.

801
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,004
MAN: ...three, two, one.

802
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,242
LISA: Good morning. Thank you
for joining us. I'm Lisa Mays.

803
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,360
BEN: And I'm Ben Waterman.

804
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,687
First up on This Morning
on KWLA News,

805
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,001
a horrible car crash
over in Benedict Canyon.

806
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,162
It's claimed the life
now of one man.

807
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,969
Severely injured
a young woman.

808
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,921
JOE: Hey, Lou!

809
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,806
Hey, man.
Joe Loder, Mayhem.

810
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,564
Great get tonight.

811
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,211
They were closing it down
by the time we showed up.

812
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,328
Were you waiting
for me out here?

813
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,562
No, I was driving by
and I saw your car.

814
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,530
You're not dropping your shit off, are you?
Nobody does that.

815
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,046
You need an air card if you
want to be in the game.

816
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,929
Import the video
to your laptop.

817
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,206
Cut the video.

818
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,725
Upload to your FTP site

819
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,041
and notify stations
you got something for sale.

820
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,690
Boom, boom, boom!

821
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,723
Otherwise,
it's a nice ride.

822
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,723
Listen, man,
you got a good run going

823
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,290
but there's valleys
out there.

824
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,045
Take it from me. I've been
nightcrawling for 14 years.

825
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,724
You heard I'm
adding a second van?

826
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,961
No. I didn't hear that.

827
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,520
Gonna be a game changer.

828
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,364
Cut my on-scene time
in half.

829
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,040
I'm setting up
a dedicated dispatch, too.

830
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,845
No more listening and driving.
That's for suckers.

831
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,684
You like the Canon 305s?

832
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,205
Never used one.

833
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,520
Six thou a piece.

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,810
2.4 megapixels. Night vision.
18:1 zoom.

835
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,641
I got one of those puppies
with your name on it.

836
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,085
I have a camera.

837
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,924
I want you
running my second van.

838
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,241
Two crews.
Half the area to cover.

839
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,731
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

840
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,080
Half the money, right?

841
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,162
You should be thinking,
twice the sales.

842
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,605
Because we're
going to be the first

843
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,881
at every scene.

844
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,088
Why compete when we
can work together?

845
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,764
You can share
my press cards.

846
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,081
Puppy dog off my
police connections.

847
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,766
This is the big move,
the next level.

848
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,080
We can corner
this whole thing.

849
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,606
I'm talking about putting some
heavy digits in our pocket, brah.

850
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,091
Thank you for
offering me the position

851
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,322
but working for
myself is more in line

852
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,890
with my skills
and career goals.

853
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,806
Take a few days
to think about it.

854
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,006
No.

855
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,281
You'll need to
hire someone else,

856
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,600
and I don't want to
hold up the process.

857
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,444
You want to be on
the inside of this, man

858
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,524
because I'm going to be
tag-teaming every call.

859
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,444
You keep talking
like it's something

860
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,887
that I may be interested
in, but I'm not.

861
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,042
You don't even
understand the offer.

862
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,521
If you did, you'd be
fucking sucking my dick!

863
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,931
You'd be asking me
questions.

864
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,809
What does this mean?
What does that mean?

865
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,282
I feel like grabbing you
by your ears right now

866
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,569
and screaming in your face,

867
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,809
"I'm not
fucking interested."

868
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,924
Instead,
I'm going to drive home
and do some accounting.

869
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,481
Fuck you!

870
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,366
Twerp.

871
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,370

(MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING)

873
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,242
(SIGHS) I didn't
wake up until 5:00.

874
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,249
My body is so off,
I feel like it's
time for breakfast.

875
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,525
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

876
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,127
I bet you're beautiful
any time of the day.

877
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,051
In fact, I'd say

878
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,884
you're much prettier
than Lisa Mays.

879
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,200
(LAUGHS)

880
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,490
I like the dark
makeup on your eyes.

881
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,164
I also like
the way you smell.

882
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,044
So, where you from, Lou?

883
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,884
The north end
of the Valley.

884
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,083
Some of the calls sometimes
take me over there,

885
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,891
but nobody I know
still lives out there.

886
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,564
You're from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

887
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,082
How did you know that?

888
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,400
It's online.

889
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,006
Everything about you
is online.

890
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,570
Not everything,
but definitely a lot.

891
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,289
I've watched all the videos
from when you were a reporter.

892
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,691
I'm sure you look
at those, of course.

893
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,205
No. God, no.

894
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,611
Not without
a drink in my hand.

895
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,241
I watch my work
all the time.

896
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,970
Yeah? Do you want
to become a reporter?

897
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,121
No.

898
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,889
Most of you guys
want air time.

899
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,570
Not me.

900
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,610
I want to be the guy that owns the
station that owns the camera.

901
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,567
The business
is going well,

902
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,483
but in order to
grow to the next level,

903
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,005
I need to stay one step
ahead of my competition

904
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,081
and take risks.

905
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,562
I also need financial support
to implement expansion.

906
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,204
Would you like
another margarita?

907
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,686
One is enough.

908
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,484
Thanks for
coming out to talk.

909
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,931
The place I'm in now

910
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,446
is that I want
a relationship

911
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,562
with someone I
can team up with

912
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,530
and share, like we share, the
same job and hours and whatnot.

913
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,489
I could go down
a laundry list,
but you get the idea.

914
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,011
Yes.

915
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,889
Well, I hope
you find someone.

916
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,569
Here's the thing
about that, Nina.

917
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,249
I'm quite certain
I already have.

918
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,371
Okay-

919
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,402
Let me put this politely.

920
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,528
I only came out to
dinner with you, Lou,

921
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,206
purely as
a professional courtesy.

922
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,965
Thank you.

923
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,241
I don't think
it's any secret

924
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,810
that I've
single-handedly raised

925
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,325
the unit price of
your ratings book.

926
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,165
Our ratings book price?
Whoa! (LAUGHS)

927
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,251
I'm a very fast learner.

928
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,243
We had a conversation where I
specifically mentioned that.

929
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,407
Do you remember that?

930
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,081
Well, do you?

931
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,605
Yes.

932
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,523
I recently learned,
for instance,

933
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,968
that most Americans watch
local news to stay informed.

934
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,961
I also learned that

935
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,844
the average half-hour of Los
Angeles television news

936
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,161
packs all of its
local government coverage

937
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,527
including law enforcement,
budget, transportation,

938
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,125
education and immigration

939
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,884
into 22 seconds.
(CHUCKLES)

940
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,930
Local crime stories,
however, not only
usually led the news

941
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,445
but filled 14
times the broadcast,

942
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,124
averaging five minutes
and seven seconds.

943
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,329
KWLA relies heavily
on such stories.

944
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,129
With Los Angeles
crime rates going down,

945
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,204
I think that makes items like
mine particularly valuable.

946
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,964
Like rare animals. (LAUGHS)

947
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,850
I can only imagine that
your needs will increase

948

during next month's
rating sweeps period.

949
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400

950

951
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,367
Yeah.

Well, we certainly

953

There's certain good things
about being alone.

954
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,080
You have time to do
the things you wanna do,

955
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,531
like study and plan,

956
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,761
but you can't have
dinners like this

957
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,080
or be physical
with a person.

958
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,049
I mean, outside
of flirtation-ship.

959
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,643
Where are you going
with this?

960
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,250
I want that.

961
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,930
With you.

962
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,524
Like you want to keep your job
and your health insurance.

963
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,331
Look, just for starters,

964
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,324
I don't need you to
keep my fucking job.

965
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,970
You're the news director
on the vampire shift

966
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,487
of the lowest-rated
station in Los Angeles.

967
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,766
We have what could be considered
an almost-exclusive relationship.

968
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,810
There are many
other places I could go.

969
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,565
I have to think that you're
invested in this transaction.

970
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
WAITER: Here you are.

971
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,001
Wow.

972
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,844
WAITER: Enjoy.
Thank you.

973
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,644
Where did you get the balls to
even suggest something like this?

974
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,006
We're still talking.

975
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,242
No. There's nothing
more to say.

976
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,685
You can leave.

977
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,085
Okay, look.

978
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,811
You've done well. Okay?

979
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,248
And we pay you well,
very well.
We always have.

980
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,201
If you like,
I could get you
an exclusive retainer.

981
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,281
That would be on top
of your segment fees.

982
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,647
I could maybe even get
you a job at the station

983
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,131
starting as
a production assistant.

984
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,202
So that you could learn the
business from the inside.

985
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,169
That's where you
said your interests lie.

986
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,561
Mmm-hmm.

987
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,890
You're not listening,
Nina.

988
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,124
I happen to know that you
haven't stayed at one station

989
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,890
for longer than
two years at a time,

990
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,724
and you're coming
up on two years soon.

991
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,040
I can imagine

992
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,241
that your contract is
for that length of time.

993
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,005
And that
next month's ratings

994
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,445
directly affect that.

995
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,569
So, you're threatening
that if I don't...

996
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,641
I'm negotiating.

997
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,324
You're threatening
to stop selling to me.

998
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,808
That's your choice.

999
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,211
The true price of any item

1000
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,930
is what somebody's
willing to pay for it.

1001
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,843
You want something.

1002
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,649
And I want you.

1003
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,926
To fuck you.

1004
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,244
And as a friend.

1005
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,211
Jesus Christ, friends
don't pressure friends

1006

to fucking sleep with them.

1007
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,808
Actually,
that's not true, Nina.

1008
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,367
Because as I'm sure
you know,

1009
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,411

you give yourself.

1012

You're putting me
on the 5?

1013

Yeah, the 2 to the 5
to the 110 to the 10.

1014
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,086

traffic memo yesterday?

1015
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,083
Did I read it?

1016
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,491
Yeah, I read it.

1017
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,722
What did it say?

1018
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,370
About the 5?

1019
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,010
Okay. I looked at it.
What?

1020
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,520
Well, for one thing,
it included that

1021
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,800
the 5 has floating construction

1022
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,126
in the fast lane for
the next three weeks.

1023
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,884
So, given that,
I expect you to put me

1024
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,849
on the 2 to the 101
to the 110 to the 10.

1025
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,248
That's half of one,
six of the other.

1026
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,685
It's half dozen of one,
six of the other.

1027
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,000
What I'd like you
to do is admit that

1028
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,560
you didn't read
what you said you did.

Okay! When am I
going to get my raise?

Rick, trying to
leverage your salary

1040
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,489
in this economic environment
is near impossible.

1041
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,369
Most firms have
set starting wages.

1042
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,488
Ideally, you could
leverage with other offers,

1043
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,891

not the case

01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,601
Have they been identified?

1253
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,364
It just happened,
so you have to assume no,

1254
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,851
and that's just
one of the issues.

1255
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,485
We can't broadcast
their identities

1256
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,050
without notifying
the next of kin.

1257
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,326
We're not identifying them.

1258
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,289
You are by proxy,
by showing their faces.

1259
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,805
We pixelate the faces.

1260
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,401
Where did you get this?

1261
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,481
Stringer.

1262
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,766
Hi, Linda. I'm Lou.

1263
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,720
Um, Jesus. ls there a dead
baby inside of there?

1264
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,086
No. The crib was empty.

1265
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,207
NINA: Oh,
for Christ's sake.

1266
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,009
Are we breaking the law
by showing this?

1267
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,161
Block the faces,
don't give out
the exact address.

1268
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,562
Do that, I guess.
(STAMMERS) I don't know.

1269
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,404
I wouldn't think so, no.

1270
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,527
Journalistically and ethically?

1271
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
This isn't Hartford.

1272
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,642
We are beyond
all broadcast standards.

1273
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,848
Have you seen
the overnights?

1274
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,126
I'll risk the fine.

1275
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,045
What did you pay for this?

1276
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,088
The price hasn't been
negotiated yet.

1277
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,166
(SIGHS)
Give us a minute.

1278
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,446
Thanks.

1279
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,568
How much?
$100,000.

1280
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,921
(CHUCKLES) How much?
$50,000.

1281
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,322
I need a number. Nine minutes.
I need a number.

1282
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,885
I just gave you two.

1283
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,200
$3,000.

1284
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,930
I got $3,000 for the
food truck stabbings.

1285
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,126
There were more dead.

1286
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,362
Those were poor Mexican
people in a roach coach.

1287
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,601
Two of them were illegals.

1288
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,120
These are three
wealthy white people,

1289
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,571
shot and killed
in their mansion.

1290
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,371
Including a suburban housewife
shotgunned in her bed.

1291
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,851
I know you, Nina.

1292
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,410
I know your interest and
excitement in this product

1293
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,160
is greater than the
amount you're offering.

01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,120
$15,000.

1302
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,083
Can't do it. Never happen.
There's a matter of precedent.

1303
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,810
Ten is my last best offer.

1304
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,927
Okay-

1305
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,240
Really?

1306
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,448
Where are you going?

1307
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,841
Seven has approached me
at least several times.

1308
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,160
The ND there
gave me his number.

1309
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,728
They'll make me a better offer.
It's a five-minute drive.

1310
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,165
Hold on!

1311
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,486
(SIGHS)

1312
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,725
Twelve.

1313
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
Fifteen.

1314
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,730
I can't spend a month's
budget on a single story.

1315
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,920
What if the story's
not over?

1316
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,884
The people who
did this escaped.

1317
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,521
They're still out there,
walking around
with the rest of us.

1318
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,444
If I had a family
and I lived in a home,
that might make me nervous.

1319
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,443
I'd want updates
on what was going on.

1320
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,200
With this footage,
people would turn to
your channel for the story.

1321
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,646
I like you, Nina.

1322
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,964
And I look forward
to our time together.

1323
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,485
But you have
to understand.

1324
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,404
$15,000 isn't
all that I want.

1325
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,209
From here on,
starting now,

1326
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,085
I want my work to be credited
by the anchors and on a burn.

1327
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,491
The name of my company is

1328
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,609
Video Production News,
a professional
news-gathering service.

1329
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,647
That's how
it should be read

1330
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,609
and that's how
it should be said.

1331
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,729
I also want to go to the next
rung, and meet your team.

1332
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,802
And the station manager and
the director and the anchors.

1333
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,968
And start developing my own
personal relationships.

1334
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,485
I'd like to start meeting
them this morning.

1335
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,927
You'll take me around,
you'll introduce me
as the owner and President

1336
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,161
of Video Production News

1337
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,323
and remind them of some
of my many other stories.

1338
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,481
I'm not done.

1339
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,086
I also want to stop our
discussion over prices.

1340
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,161
This will save time.

1341
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,401
When I say that
a particular number

1342
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,200
is my lowest price,
that's my lowest price.

1343
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,321
And you can be
assured that I arrived

1344
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,522
at whatever that number
is very carefully.

1345
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:27,128
Now, when I say that
I want these things,

1346
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,009
I mean that I want them.

1347
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,128
And I don't want to
have to ask again.

1348
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,685
And the last thing
that I want, Nina,

1349
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,285
is for you to do the things
that I ask you to do

1350
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,771
when we're alone together
in your apartment.

1351
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,285
Not like the last time!

1352
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,487
So...

1353
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,971
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

1354
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,649
I'll tell you what.
(SNIFFLES)

1355
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,483
I have the van crash
on Moorpark tonight.

1356
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,164
It was a couple of
stringers, actually.

1357
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,402
That could lead by itself
on an average night.

1358
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,203
I'd be willing to
throw that in for free.

1359
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,929
So what do you say,
do we have a deal?

Ben Waterman, Lou Bloom.

1361

Hi.
Hello. How are you, Lisa?

1362
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,726
You remember Lou from
the Benedict Canyon crash.

1363
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,040
BEN: Oh, yeah.
Amazing stuff.

1364
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,487
That was my company,

1365
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,721
I would just like to say

1366
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,441
that I think that what the two of
you do is incredibly valuable.

1367
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,891
Thank you. That's
nice of you to say.

1368
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,729
We appreciate it.

01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,885
You shot the video
in the house?

1550
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,168
Yes, ma'am, I did.
That's right.

1551
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,722
You went inside the house? You
filmed all through the house?

1552
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,806
You even filmed the bodies.

1553
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,681
All before the police came.

1554
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,046
That door was open, ma'am.

Detective.

1556
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,130
The door was open
and what I did was

1557
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,486
I went in to see
if I could help,

1558
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,971
because the alarm was ringing.

1559
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,491
An active crime scene.

1560
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,244
I didn't know
it was a crime scene.

1561
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,600
LIEBERMAN:
You knew what it was.

1562
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,087
LOU: I know that an alarm
means someone is in trouble.

1563
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,965
And you sold it
to be shown on TV.

1564
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,760
We're a professional
news-gathering service.

1565
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,128
LIEBERMAN: What did you
see when you arrived?

1566
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,567
Uh, two men
leaving in a vehicle.

1567
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:28,926
You saw two men?

1568
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,970
(STUTTERS) They were just shapes, really.
I was afraid, so I hid.

1569
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,644
And then I saw
the shapes of two men

1570
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,722
moving inside the vehicle,
if that helps.

1571
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,006
Describe the men.

1572
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,206
LOU: it was dark.

1573
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,084
And then they drove away.

1574
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,003
Black? White? Tall?
LOU: I couldn't see.

1575
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,286
LIEBERMAN:
What were they driving?

1576
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,561
An SUV.

1577
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,491
Dark-colored.

1578
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,529
Rims? Tinted windows?

1579
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,762
Maybe. Not that I saw.

1580
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,042
Do you have any film
on the men or the car?

1581
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,761
No, I don't. I only started
filming when I was inside.

1582
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,841
FRONTIERI: Mmm-hmm.

1583
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,130
I'd like a copy
of that footage.

1584
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,603
Do I have to give it to you?
(CHUCKLES)

1585
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,202
ls there any reason
why you wouldn't?

1586
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,090
No, no, I made you a copy.
I expected someone to come.

(SEAT BELT CLICKS)

One of the people in the
house last night was alive.

1599
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,607
I cut that part out.

1600
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,444
I also cut out the men
leaving in their car.

1601
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,640
I have a name and an address.
We're gonna drive there.

We're gonna find the person
that drove that car.

1603

So you know
who killed those people?

One of them,
quite possibly, yes.

1605
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,084
You gotta call the cops.

1606
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,685
And we will,
at the right time.

1607
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,088
I'm offering you a real
opportunity here, Rick.

To do what?

1609

I don't usually share

that could allow the company

to make enough money
to expand to the next level.

1613
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,088
We could call this

1614
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,928
the critical moment.

1615
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,002
I'm inviting you, Rick,
to be a part of the team

on this opportunity.

Yeah.

For starters,

1621
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,886
I've been seeing
a great improvement

1622
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,928
in your overall focus
and order-following.

1623
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,521
Given complex problems, you're
developing a real ability

to find clear
and simple solutions.

For what?

if he's actually inside.

a better or more

But, remember,

He confirmed it with an
investigator at the scene.

2015
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:08,886
It wasn't a home invasion.
It was a drug robbery.

2017

This is news.

2018
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:14,605
It detracts from the story.

2019
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,250
It is the story.

2020
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,449
The story is urban crime
creeping into the suburbs.

2021
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,124
That's the story.

at the Chinatown Express tonight

2038
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:11,891
and called the 911?

2039
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,041
Of course.

2040
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,963
It began earlier in the day.

2041
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,288
I was watering my plant.

2042
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,767
I looked out my window
at my apartment.

2043
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,888
The one you visited.

2044
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,243
I saw a dark-colored vehicle with two
men inside parked across the street.

2045
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,287
I didn't think anything of it,

2046
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:30,920
otherwise I would have
reported it then.

2047
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,009
We began our night,

2048
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:40,046
my employee and myself.

2049
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:43,044
And around
approximately 12:38,

2050
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:45,009
I looked in my
rearview mirror

2051
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,162
and I saw what looked
like the same men

2052
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,368
in the same vehicle
following us.

2053
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,680
I made an evasive maneuver.

2054
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:53,684
I circled back and tailed
them to the restaurant.

2055
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,251
At which point,
I saw them go inside

2056
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:58,369
and recognized them as the same
men from the home invasion.

2057
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,249
You told me
you didn't see the men.

2058
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:02,880
That you didn't get
a good look at them.

2059
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:06,283
Well, it all came back to me
when I saw them going in.

2060
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,840
Their shapes
and their movements.

2061
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,126
And then I saw that one of the
men had a gun under his shirt,

2062
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:15,443
so I immediately got my
phone and dialed 911.

2063
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,601
That's your story?

2064
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:19,081
That's what happened. That's
why I'm sitting here with you.

2065
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,891
I think that
the men saw my footage

2066
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,364
and they tracked me down.

2067
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,043
You want to know
what I think?

2068
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,486
Yes, please.

2069
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,727
I think you withheld
information.

2070
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:36,643
I think you saw the two men in the
murder house in Granada Hills

2071
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:40,042
and you saw the car
and you sat on it

2072
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,042
to get something
you could film.

2073
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,402
What do you think
about that?

2074
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,168
I think that would be

2075
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:51,891
a very unprofessional thing
for me to do in my business.

2076
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,208
It would be murder.

2077
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:55,645
I can understand why
you're looking into it,

2078
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,171
but I didn't do
anything like that.

2079
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,685
Nothing that could
be considered wrong.

2080
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:00,250
You don't fool me
for a minute.

2081
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,845
I'm glad.

2082
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,885
I think everything
you said is a lie.

2083
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,842
I wish my partner was here
to back up what happened.

2084
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,843
You left your dead partner.

2085
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,001
