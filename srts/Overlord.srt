<i>Allied naval forces,</i>

this morning</i>

1306

coast of France.</i>

ROBERT ST. JOHN:
<i>This is a momentous hour</i>

1309
01:39:10,367 --> 01:39:11,800
<i>in world history.</i>

1310
01:39:11,802 --> 01:39:15,198
<i>This is the invasion
of Hitler's Europe.</i>

1311
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,732
<i>The zero hour
of the second front.</i>

1312
01:39:17,734 --> 01:39:19,999
<i>The men of General
Dwight Eisenhower</i>

1313

their landing barges,</i>

1314
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:23,800
<i>fighting their way
up the beaches</i>

1315
01:39:23,802 --> 01:39:25,799
<i>into the fortress
of Nazi Europe.</i>

1316
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:27,266
Yeah, Boyce!

1317
01:39:27,268 --> 01:39:29,366
<i>They are moving in from
the sea to attack the enemy</i>

1318
01:39:29,368 --> 01:39:31,533
<i>under a mammoth cloud
of fighter planes</i>

1319
01:39:31,535 --> 01:39:33,865
<i>under a ceiling
of screaming shells</i>

1320
01:39:33,867 --> 01:39:35,465
<i>from Allied warships.</i>

1321
01:39:35,467 --> 01:39:38,198
<i>The first news flashes
do not say,</i>

1322
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,899
<i>but a large proportion
of this assault</i>

1323
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:43,299
<i>is believed to be in the hands
of America's men.</i>

1324
01:39:43,301 --> 01:39:45,399
<i>They unleashed the attack
side by side</i>

1325
01:39:45,401 --> 01:39:47,002

TIBBET: Ford?

1328
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:19,665
You had plenty of explosive to
take the tower out above ground,

1329
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:21,931
but you went below
to set the charges.

1330
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:23,732
BOYCE: Yes, sir.

1331
01:40:23,734 --> 01:40:26,466
Why would you do something
like that, Private?

1332
01:40:26,468 --> 01:40:29,298
Corporal Ford thought
it was best.

1333
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,831
The number of
enemy troops, he...

1334
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:36,502
He didn't feel we'd be able to hold
them off long enough outside, sir.

1335
01:40:37,767 --> 01:40:40,964
Well, your corporal
made a hell of a good call.

1336
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:43,432
I just wish he were here
for me to tell him that.

1337
01:40:43,434 --> 01:40:44,764
So do I, sir.

1338
01:40:44,766 --> 01:40:45,732
Go catch a breath.

1339
01:40:45,734 --> 01:40:47,469
We're gonna fold you
into Charlie Company.

1340
01:40:48,468 --> 01:40:49,801
At ease, Private.

1341
01:40:53,168 --> 01:40:54,569
Oh, Private?

1342
01:40:59,568 --> 01:41:02,232
Did you see anything else
when you were down there?

1343
01:41:02,234 --> 01:41:05,834
There's talk about
some kind of Kraut lab.

1344
01:41:06,601 --> 01:41:07,898
So if there's anything
down there

1345
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,801
that's worth us digging
through all that rubble,

1346
01:41:11,867 --> 01:41:13,467
you'd let us know, right?

1347
01:41:16,534 --> 01:41:18,602
Just the tower control room.

1348
01:41:19,734 --> 01:41:22,002
But there's nothing
left of that, sir.

1349
01:41:24,866 --> 01:41:26,266
That's what I figured.

1350
01:41:26,268 --> 01:41:28,466
Good job, soldier.
You and your squad.

1351
01:41:28,468 --> 01:41:29,935
Thank you, sir.

1352
01:41:32,367 --> 01:41:33,498
TIBBET: No wilds.

1353
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,633
Matchsticks, five.
Buttons, ten.

1354
01:41:35,635 --> 01:41:38,865
Are you ready? Ante up.
Including you, kid.

He throws two,
and I calls me that...

1357
01:41:44,335 --> 01:41:45,798
Finally got yourself a friend.

1358
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,665
PAUL: Hey!

1359
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,502
Kid's bugging the hell
out of me.

1360
01:41:49,134 --> 01:41:50,864
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1361
01:41:50,866 --> 01:41:52,299
All right. Two to you.

1362
01:41:52,301 --> 01:41:53,832
- You look better.
- ROSENFELD: Thanks.

1363
01:41:53,834 --> 01:41:55,298
Now I just got to
convince somebody

1364
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,932
how I helped save the war.

1365
01:41:56,934 --> 01:41:59,899
TIBBET: Save the war?
All I saw was you missing

1366
01:41:59,901 --> 01:42:01,699
a bunch of Germans
with a machine gun.

1367
01:42:01,701 --> 01:42:03,565
ROSENFELD: Are you kidding?
I saved your ass out there.

1368
01:42:03,567 --> 01:42:05,498
TIBBET: Is that what happened?
I don't remember that.

1369
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,934
Do you remember that?

1370
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,265
No? That's what I thought.

1371
01:42:09,267 --> 01:42:10,366
Did you get your orders?

1372
01:42:10,368 --> 01:42:11,699
Yeah, they're putting us
in C Company.

1373
01:42:11,701 --> 01:42:13,898
Jesus Christ,
after all that?

1374
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,901
I thought they would just
send us the fuck home.

1375
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:17,899
Got a job to finish.

1376
01:42:17,901 --> 01:42:20,168
We got to get
Tibbet to Hitler.

1377
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:23,198
And then pop!

1378
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,667
We all go home.
