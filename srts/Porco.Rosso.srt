<i>PORCO ROSSO</i>

4
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,319
Yeah?

5
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,816
<i>Porco Rosso! The Mamma Aiutos
are on the move.</i>

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,695
The Mamma Aiutos?
I don't work cheap, you know.

7
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,956
<i>They're after a mine's payroll
out of Venice.</i>

8
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,165
Is that all?

9
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,251
<i>Uh, no...</i>

10
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,000
<i>There's a school tour group aboard.</i>

11
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,920
That'll cost you.

12
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,005
<i>We'll pay top dollar.</i>

13
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,548
And a bonus too.

14
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,923
Stop!

15
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,851
Stop or we sink you.

16
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,016
Wow, pirates!

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,856
Not just pirates. Air pirates!

18
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,052
Time for an overhaul.

19
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,745
Are you bad guys?

20
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,870
Yep-

21
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,505
And we're hostages?

22
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,544
Right.

23
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,087
Are you air pirates?

24
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,255
Smart girl.

25
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,760
A skull!

26
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,470
And very well-drawn.

27
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,432
Come on, hurry up!

28
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,723
There's 15 of them.
Do we take them all?

29
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,518
We can't leave anyone out.

30
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,662
Too late!

31
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,661
They took the girls and the money.

32
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,830
Bring them back!

33
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,341
They went that way.

34
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,845
No, not that way!

35
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,648
I know what those cheapskates
are up to.

36
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,820
They'll change course for the nearest
island as soon as they're out of sight.

37
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,193
They can't waste gas.

38
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,693
Uh-oh.

39
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,994
Come on!

40
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,885
I don't have much time.

41
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,145
Gotcha!

42
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,705
What, it's just a tour group.

43
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,875
Hey, it's a pig. A Pig!

44
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,418
Hey, piggy! He's so cute!

45
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,924
Be careful or
the pirates will get you.

46
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,424
He's so cool!

47
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,774
Will you all shut up?

48
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,032
We're flying!

49
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,071
Let me see!

50
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,944
Hey, cut that out!

51
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,239
Be quiet, will you?

52
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,741
Do something!

53
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,419
You're the one who said
to bring them all.

54
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,382
Just for a second.
I'm not supposed to let you.

55
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,011
It's beautiful.
Hey, look!

56
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,797
A red plane!

57
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,723
Where? Where?

58
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,433
We saw it, didn't we?

59
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,645
That's as far as you go.

60
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,981
Here he comes!

61
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,988
- It's Porco!
- I can't see!

62
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,654
Oh, no!

63
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,787
It stopped.

64
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,952
We'll crash!

65
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,166
No, we've got another engine.

66
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,215
What are you doing?
Shoot him down!

67
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,127
That red plane's tough.

68
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,969
<i>Missed!</i>

69
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,231
Message from the pig.
“You're beat. Do what I say.”

70
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,399
Shut up!

71
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,117
He's coming. Get down!

72
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,871
Where did he go?

73
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,031
He's hiding.

74
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,048
We crashed. We're going to sink!

75
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,842
No we won't.
This is a seaplane.

76
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,607
We're sinking.

77
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,439
Hey, stop that!

78
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,855
Halt! You're hostages.

79
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,575
Don't worry.
We're on the swim team.

80
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,156
That's not what I mean!

81
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,246
Another message.

82
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:14,416
“You can keep half the money.
Give me the rest and the kids.”

83
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,714
Or I'll kill you all.

84
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,832
That's it.

85
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,879
Half the money?

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,471
Shut up! Come on, you swine.
It's you and me!

87
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,927
Eat lead!

88
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,727
It jammed!

89
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,777
Bye-bye!

90
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,403
Farewell!

91
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,781
He left us money for repairs.

92
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,575
Don't be such a sap.

93
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,301
Be quiet, will you?

94
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,468
Don't pull on that,
you'll break it.

95
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,095
Stay away from the propeller.

96
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,642
Got to pee? Do it over there.

97
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,612
So the Mamma Aiutos
can't come tonight.

98
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,950
And that filthy pig
of a bounty hunter is a hero.

99
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,453
But this young kid's
an American, right?

100
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,495
The air pirates of the Adriatic,
asking a Yankee for help!

101
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,624
His grandmother was part Italian.

102
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,500
And he'll finish Porco for us.

103
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,001
But ten per cent is outrageous.

104
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,197
Beautiful.

105
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,402
He's here.

106
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,784
With his snout in the air,
as always.

107
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,299
<i>Mr.</i> Porco <i>Rosso?
I'm from The Neptune.</i>

108
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:56,092
We hear you put
the Mamma Aiutos out of action.

109
00:11:56,216 --> 00:12:01,097
Do you think that will affect
this year's bounties?

110
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,474
Hey, put me down!

111
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,070
Listen to the music.

112
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,956
She's quite a woman.

113
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:25,162
Even American pilots know
Madame Gina of the Hotel Adriano.

114
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,041
That's why we all
leave our quarrels outside.

115
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,501
Is that your Curtiss out front?

116
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,714
The Rattlesnake.
Winner of fame and fortune.

117
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:40,139
You took the Schneider Cup
two years running.

118
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,350
She's unbeatable
in a dogfight, too.

119
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,481
But I hear there's this Porco Rosso
who's pretty famous, too.

120
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,984
Better watch your back
with those pirates, kid.

121
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,698
They're poor, cheap, and dirty.
They could use a bath.

122
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,032
That's true.

123
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,623
Who you calling dirty, pig?

124
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:06,165
Quite a distinguished gathering!
You boys must be planning something.

125
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,545
As usual.

126
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,425
Always glad to see you,
but no war games here, okay?

127
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,431
We know, Gina. We never work
within 50 kilometers of here.

128
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,221
We're even nice to the pig.

129
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,016
That's my boys.

130
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,521
See you again.

131
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,909
Porco, tell us a war story.

132
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,910
Next time we're alone.

133
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,164
That American is so funny.

134
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,214
He took one look
and said marry me.

135
00:13:55,918 --> 00:14:00,219
I told him I'd lost
three pilot husbands already.

136
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,437
One in combat, one in the Atlantic.
The third died in Asia.

137
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,938
They found him?

138
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:17,115
I got a call today.
They found the wreckage in Bengal.

139
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,077
I waited three years.
I've got no tears left.

140
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,585
The good always get killed.
To comrades.

141
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,965
Thanks, Marco.
You're always here for me.

142
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,975
You're the only one left
from the old days.

143
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,725
One thing I don't like
about this place...

144
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,477
is that picture.

145
00:14:55,395 --> 00:15:01,118
Don't touch it. It's the only one
of you when you were human.

146
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,370
I wish I could release you
from that spell.

147
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,061
That Yank knows how to fly.

148
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,639
Must be nice to make that much money.

149
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,766
This month's payment.

150
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,302
That pays off your loan.

151
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:14,604
How about helping the people out
with a Patriot Bond?

152
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,565
Do I look like a person?

153
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,713
All ready for you,
Mr. Porco Rosso.

154
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,919
I'll take some ammo too.

155
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,465
The streets are packed.

156
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,216
Yeah? Maybe the government's
going to change again.

157
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,764
They'll pass a law against you guys.

158
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,600
Laws don't apply to pigs.

159
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,733
That's for sure. Or moles like me.

160
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,775
Just regular ammo?
No high-explosive or armor-piercing?

161
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,115
We're not fighting a war
out there, kid.

162
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,278
See you.

163
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,947
Thank you!

164
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,044
Hey, Boss. How is war
different from bounty hunting?

165
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:23,589
War profiteers are villains.
Bounty hunters are just stupid.

166
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,593
We're air pirates.
We don't borrow from banks.

167
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,091
What else can we do?

168
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,427
These repairs were expensive.

169
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,812
Pirate Federation planes!

170
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,903
Why do we have to fly with
that bunch of losers?

171
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,117
It's all the pig's fault.

172
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,829
Can't those Mamma Aiutos
even afford paint?

173
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,831
That is so shabby.

174
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,834
It looks like everyone's here.

175
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,337
Hey, is the American here yet?

176
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,631
He's up in the sun.

177
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,671
Right where he should be.

178
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,892
<i>Sighted target:
The Mediterranean Queen.</i>

179
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,352
We're taking a ship that big?

180
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,648
That's why we all got together.

181
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,985
Having engine trouble. Go first.
We'll cover you.

182
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,152
That's a dirty trick!
We follow the plan.

183
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,659
Then we share repair costs!

184
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:38,167
You gutless wonder! We pay
our own repairs, just like always.

185
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,668
Engine trouble! Engine trouble!

186
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,007
We settled all this before!

187
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,675
All of you, shut up!

188
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,304
<i>Attention! We are under attack
by air pirates.</i>

189
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:01,353
<i>There is no need for alarm.</i>

190
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,274
<i>We carry two advanced fighter aircraft.</i>

191
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,190
<i>We will now introduce our pilots.</i>

192
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,492
<i>The Black Stallion, Signor Valleta.</i>

193
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,877
<i>And the Wolf of the Tiber,
Signor Visconti.</i>

194
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,513
- They brought muscle!
- That wasn't in the deal!

195
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,276
Aw, what a mess.

196
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,108
Get away from me, Curtiss!

197
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,694
All right, let's go!

198
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,925
That's not good.

199
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,759
Guess I have to go to Milan.

200
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,600
<i>Both pilots were shot down,
but parachuted to safety.</i>

201
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:30,613
<i>The Pirate Federation looted
the vessel and left this message.</i>

202
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,652
You're next!

203
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,447
Come and get us, pig!

204
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,452
<i>We repeat...</i>

205
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,456
<i>You're next. Come and get us, pig.</i>

206
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,998
Way to go, turkeys.

207
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,672
I'm afraid I'm on vacation.

208
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:59,931
White sheets, beautiful women.

209
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,314
Just get me to Milan, little engine.

210
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:38,423
I don't like this weather.
I'll have to fly low.

211
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,772
Come on, you can do it!

212
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,494
That's right. Good girl!

213
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,924
Pig!

214
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,310
It's one on one!

215
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,311
Not now!

216
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,990
I'll tell everyone you ran.

217
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,485
Catch you later, Yank!

218
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,114
Damn, lost my cover.

219
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:30,959
Uh-oh.

220
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:32,995
Gotcha!

221
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,003
No you didn't. My engine quit.

222
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,855
Yes! Now I'll be famous too. Yahoo!

223
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:13,916
I can't go back empty-handed.
They won't believe me without proof.

224
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,752
There!

225
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,030
That stupid red color. No mistake.

226
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,406
A souvenir for my mama in Alabama.

227
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,784
Please hurry.

228
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,756
Madame Gina!

229
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,089
There's a phone call.
He's safe. He's alive.

230
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,047
Use the phone at the front desk.

231
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,480
Marco? Are you all right?
I was just leaving to look for you.

232
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,238
Oh? Good!

233
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,279
<i>I've lost weight.
Two nights on a deserted island.</i>

234
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:13,998
I'm taking the plane
to Milan for repairs.

235
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,581
<i>If the Yank comes in,
tell him I'll see him again.</i>

236
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,497
<i>Hey! I'm not a messenger.</i>

237
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:28,012
I worry about you pilots,
but you treat me like the furniture.

238
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:35,520
Marco, you'll end up roasted.
I won't go to your funeral.

239
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,439
A pig's gotta fly.

240
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,307
<i>Idiot!</i>

241
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:38,078
I figured you'd show up tonight.

242
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,708
I need your help.

243
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,044
Looks pretty bad.

244
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,247
Why not just get a new plane?

245
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,916
I like this one.

246
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,043
I know how you feel.

247
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,388
Look out. I'll back her in.

248
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,685
Who's the cutie?

249
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,021
My granddaughter,
back from the States.

250
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,106
Keep coming, keep coming.

251
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:30,134
What a beautiful plane, Grandpa!
It's got great lines.

252
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,096
They don't make them
like that anymore.

253
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,593
I can't see it.

254
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,809
She's really your granddaughter?

255
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,386
Hands off.

256
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,725
Fio, lock up.

257
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,442
Okay.

258
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,023
I'm going up against Curtiss.
I need another 15 knots.

259
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,113
Curtiss? I haven't heard
that name for a while.

260
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,327
Well?

261
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,333
Where did you get a Folgore?

262
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,792
Don't ask.

263
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:11,300
The plane Curtiss beat in 1927 for
the Schneider Cup had this engine.

264
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,297
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was a fool.

265
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,299
I can hardly wait.

266
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,766
Don't over-tune her.
It's not a race.

267
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:27,479
Tell me about it!
You're preaching to the converted.

268
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,655
You're cleaning me out.

269
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:38,995
These days money's not worth
the paper it's printed on.

270
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,698
Empty your pockets.
That's for the propeller, the paint...

271
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,368
That's for hotel and meals!

272
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,997
Stay here. I'll put you up cheap.

273
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,301
Where are your sons? Are they good?

274
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,220
They left to find work.

275
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,472
So who'll do the design?

276
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,890
Fio.

277
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,894
Fio? That little girl?

278
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:08,562
She's young, but she's got
something my sons don't.

279
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:18,026
I've known you a long time,
but I think I'll try somewhere else.

280
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,865
Wait!

281
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,378
It is because I'm a girl?
Or because I'm young?

282
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,414
Both, actually.

283
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,708
Well, I can understand that.

284
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,430
Tell me, what's the main thing
a good pilot needs?

285
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,889
Experience?

286
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,135
No. Inspiration.

287
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,012
I'm glad you didn't say experience.

288
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:52,151
Grandpa says you were very young
when you first soloed.

289
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,154
You were good from the start.

290
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,116
That was 1910. I was 17.

291
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,615
I'm 17 too!

292
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,163
I can't help being a girl,
but we've got your old blueprints.

293
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,163
If it's no good, you don't have to pay.
Okay, Grandpa?

294
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,840
She'll do fine.

295
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,669
I was overhauling engines
when I was 12.

296
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,174
Sleep on it.

297
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:25,267
Shower's hot. Towels on the rack.
Breakfast at 7. Good night.

298
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,317
You're short, but we're friends.
I'll loan you the rest.

299
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,530
Good morning. Sleep okay?

300
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,191
Did you work all night?

301
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,034
Just a rough idea.

302
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:28,618
Same wing plan
with a different cross section.

303
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,788
That should give us five knots.

304
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:37,214
The original plans are amazing.
The old wings were monocoque.

305
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,379
I've never seen anything like it.

306
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,219
Whoever designed this wing
really understood wood.

307
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,172
I'm so impressed.

308
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:50,678
They only built one.
They said it was too dangerous to fly.

309
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,938
Found it in a warehouse.

310
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,056
What luck.

311
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,527
With this wing sweep,
I'm surprised you even get lift.

312
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:05,360
Takeoffs and landings are tricky.
No one can touch her in the air.

313
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,410
Sweep the wings
half a degree more.

314
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,578
The rest is fine.

315
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,462
So you'll let me do it?
Thank you! You won't be sorry.

316
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,965
But on one condition.

317
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,009
Don't work all night.
You need sleep to do good work.

318
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,469
And to look good, too.

319
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,766
All right.

320
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:35,939
Actually, I was so nervous
last night I couldn't sleep.

321
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:40,273
To tell the truth, I was afraid
you wouldn't let me do it.

322
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,779
I'm so happy! I'll make some coffee.

323
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,869
I hope she's not going to
build it herself too.

324
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:02,751
My niece Monica will do the drawings,
my nephew's wife the finishing...

325
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,963
My cousin's daughters, Sophia,
Laura, Constance and Valentina.

326
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:13,136
Fio's sister Giliola. Sandra's her cousin.
Marietta, you've gotten so pretty.

327
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:18,148
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna,
and her sister Miletta.

328
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,937
Porcelino!

329
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,856
Grandma!

330
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,817
The angels haven't
come for you yet?

331
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,151
You've grown into a fine man!

332
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,996
You all work here, too?

333
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,792
To buy things for
our great grandchildren.

334
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,796
Not a single man.

335
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,137
They're all family?

336
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:54,977
Yeah. There's no work here.
The men are all away working.

337
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,430
This depression...

338
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:03,690
Don't worry. The women are
tough and they work hard.

339
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,693
We're not making pancakes here.

340
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,203
Our Lord who art in Heaven...

341
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:21,708
We thank Thee for giving our
struggling company work and bread.

342
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,717
Forgive our using women's hands
to build a fighter plane.

343
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,974
Let's eat up and get to work!

344
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,362
Hear that? She's perfect.

345
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,530
How do you like them RPMs?

346
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,080
Watch out or you'll blow
the shed away.

347
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,204
Curtiss doesn't stand a chance.

348
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,449
Yeah, it's a good idea.

349
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,372
So can I do it?

350
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,081
Well, this is going to cost
a lot more money.

351
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:50,217
We're way over budget already.
Ask our sponsor.

352
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,507
Porco...

353
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,810
Don't look at me like that.
Do whatever you like.

354
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,935
Great! I'll tell the workshop
and we'll get to work.

355
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,103
Porco, I love you!

356
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,443
I can wait three months.

357
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,900
Maybe I'll become a pirate.

358
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,575
She's a good kid, huh?

359
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,653
Hands off.

360
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,282
That's the furthest thing from my mind.

361
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,862
So you made Squadron Leader.

362
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,781
Why did you come back?

363
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,997
I go where I want, Ferrarin.

364
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,915
The authorities don't like it.
Did you notice you're being tailed?

365
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,127
Yeah.

366
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:57,053
There are warrants out on you for
treason, illegal entry, decadence...

367
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,092
...pornography, and being a lazy pig.

368
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,641
It's not funny!

369
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,478
They want to seize your plane, too.

370
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,390
This is a lousy film.

371
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:16,109
Come back to the Air Force, Marco.
I could still get you in.

372
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,566
Better a pig than a Fascist.

373
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,742
Freelance daredevils are finished.

374
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,123
To fly now you need a government
or an airline to pay you.

375
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,080
I only fly for myself.

376
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,713
Wherever you fly,
you're still a pig.

377
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,210
Thanks, Ferrarin.
Say hello to the guys.

378
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,304
This is a good film.

379
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,433
Watch your back.
They won't bother with a trial.

380
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,887
See you, buddy.

381
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,036
Want a ride?

382
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,002
Good timing.

383
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:27,343
I borrowed this to take the plane
to the lake for tests tomorrow.

384
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,057
No tests. I've got no time.

385
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,687
Don't be stupid!
I won't deliver an untested plane.

386
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,563
We can take it apart and get it
to the lake in a day.

387
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,526
I said there's no time.
Take a look behind us.

388
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,911
The Fascist Secret Police.

389
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,914
They followed you.

390
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,876
Me? Why?

391
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:58,716
Because they're following me.
And you're fixing my plane.

392
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,546
Porco, are you a spy?

393
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,719
Me, a spy?

394
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,274
I don't work hard enough
to be a spy.

395
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,190
But you were a war hero.

396
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,113
Why follow an innocent man?

397
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,566
My thoughts exactly.

398
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,697
Whoops! Wrong way.

399
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,971
Doesn't seem like
you've been doing nothing.

400
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,260
Time to get busy.

401
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,037
It's ready to fly.

402
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,837
There's two men out back
and three in front.

403
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,834
This is so exciting!

404
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,758
Settle down, Grandma.

405
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,717
I'll see you.

406
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,692
What are you doing?

407
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,158
I'm coming with you.
Give me five minutes.

408
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,989
What are you talking about?
Don't be stupid!

409
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,958
Shh! Don't shout.

410
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,001
Listen to me, Fio.

411
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,125
You're a respectable woman.
And you're not married.

412
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,671
Hold this.

413
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,131
Thanks. I just finished this.

414
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,678
Perfect!

415
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,222
Hold that, will you?

416
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:27,030
Look, I'm a bounty hunter.
I'm not running a tourist service.

417
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:34,037
I want to get my first job right.
I can make adjustments as we go.

418
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:40,036
I'm taking off from the canal.
I might not even get airborne.

419
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:45,711
All the more reason to take me.
You'll need a mechanic against Curtiss.

420
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:50,713
I'm a man. We'll be all alone
on a deserted island.

421
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,965
Great. I love camping.

422
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,137
That's not the point.

423
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,726
Take her along. If you don't
beat Curtiss, we don't get paid.

424
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,899
If you don't pay, we go broke.

425
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,734
You're her grandfather!

426
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:10,240
I'll give you a break on her salary
and throw in this voice tube.

427
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,451
They'll put a price on her head.

428
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,572
No. I'll be your hostage.

429
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:21,748
We'll tell the police you forced us
to help you. That'll be our excuse.

430
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:27,082
Please take me with you.
I'll make myself useful.

431
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,927
Take out the right machine gun.

432
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:37,558
I don't care how small your bottom is,
that's a tight fit.

433
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,934
Okay! My hips are bigger
than they look. Wait a minute.

434
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,603
We better leave before Grandma
decides to come too.

435
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,896
Hey, that's an idea!

436
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,075
Grandma, quick!

437
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,448
No souvenirs, please.

438
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,421
Contact!

439
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,261
Open up!

440
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,308
Let go!

441
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:51,337
Kidnapper! Pay us our money!

442
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,634
How's the rudder, Porco?

443
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,642
A handful, just like you.
I can barely control it.

444
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,360
Stop and I'll fix it.

445
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,363
No time. I've got to get her up.

446
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,868
<i>This water's like glue!</i>

447
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:21,988
Barge ahead!

448
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,042
Here we go!

449
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,082
Come on, baby!

450
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,088
The flaps are in the water.
Use your tabs.

451
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:35,880
Tabs?

452
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,215
They're new.

453
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,596
<i>Quick!</i>

454
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,234
That's right. Now you're behaving.

455
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:33,769
Beautiful. The world is so beautiful.

456
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,277
Are they after us?

457
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,658
He's not stalking us.

458
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,325
But that's an Air Force plane.

459
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,785
It's Ferrarin.

460
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,081
You know him?

461
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:59,468
The Air Force is waiting for us.
He'll show us a way through.

462
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,528
He says to fly low
to the Adriatic.

463
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,450
Thanks, buddy!

464
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,820
Thank you!

465
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,165
He saw you and signaled
“pearls before swine.”

466
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,491
Beautiful.

467
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,904
A single rose blooming
in a secret garden.

468
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,995
Naughty boy.
This is a private garden.

469
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,501
You've got to read this.

470
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,755
It's from Hollywood.

471
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:11,764
“Regarding your starring in
the movie script you sent...”

472
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,604
I'm going to be a star,
I'm sure of it.

473
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,233
<i>The</i> movie's called
<i>Flower of the Adriatic.</i>

474
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,267
Nice name.

475
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,436
Like it? Then it's settled.

476
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,273
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

477
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:31,616
Being a hired gun
is just a rung on the ladder.

478
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,623
The next rung is Hollywood star.

479
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,124
And then?

480
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,126
President!

481
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:50,715
I'm serious. I'll make you
First Lady, Gina. I mean it.

482
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,132
Gina!

483
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,308
You're a dreamer.
I like that in a man.

484
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,471
Really?

485
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,359
But I can't go.
I'm gambling right now.

486
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:11,615
Gambling someone will visit me here,
and I'll tell him I love him.

487
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,998
But the fool only comes
to the club at night.

488
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,164
He never comes out in daylight.

489
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,875
That jerk is back!

490
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,270
You fool.

491
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,659
He kept going. I lost again.

492
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,791
You mean you're betting
on that jerk?

493
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,413
Why not?

494
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,959
Life here is more complicated
than in your country.

495
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,291
Romance is easy, but...

496
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,469
Good luck in Hollywood, kid.

497
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,175
<i>Kid?</i>

498
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,721
I bumped my head
when you did that roll.

499
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,140
Just saying hello to a friend.

500
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,188
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

501
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:54,281
The woman in white on the terrace?
Grandpa told me.

502
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,990
All the pilots in the Adriatic
are in love with Gina.

503
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,782
He's got a big mouth.

504
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,784
What's she like?
Are you in love with her too?

505
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,295
I'm putting down.
Shut up or you'll bite your tongue.

506
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,005
Wait. Hey!

507
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,737
A girl in a fighter plane!

508
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,152
Where's Porco?

509
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,746
Talking politics with my dad.

510
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,247
It's not just the caretaker government.
It's the royalists, too.

511
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:51,168
They want to link up
with the Pirates' Federation.

512
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,005
There's no money in
chasing pirates any more.

513
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,001
There.

514
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,048
Thanks.

515
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,888
All this talk about a depression!

516
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:03,768
You ought to sell
your services somewhere, too.

517
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,895
A good pilot can make good money.

518
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,229
Got any smokes?

519
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,562
Curtiss'll go back to the States soon.

520
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:15,233
We're the ones who should
go to America.

521
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:20,072
Farewell to days of fun
and freedom in the Adriatic.

522
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,823
Is that Byron?

523
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,912
No, it's me. See you.

524
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,081
Porco, it's terrible!

525
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,918
Their fuel costs three times
more than in Italy.

526
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,918
Give us a break.

527
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,385
We don't water our gas here.
Girls are so stupid.

528
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,592
Talk to her, will you?

529
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,719
Pay him, Fio.

530
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,440
Then stuff your bigger-than-it-looks
backside in the jump seat.

531
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,271
We're off.

532
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,604
The fuel goes on your bill!

533
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:06,079
He wasn't gouging us.
It's give and take.

534
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:11,418
It's pretty around here,
but everyone's broke.

535
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,627
There's the island.

536
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:37,819
It's beautiful!

537
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,254
What a great hideout.

538
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,168
Agh! My butt's gone to sleep.

539
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,859
Look at you silly idiots.

540
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,073
Boss! We got him!

541
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,826
Watch who you're stepping on!

542
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,619
Out of my way!

543
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,114
We've been waiting, pig.

544
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,865
We knew you were coming.

545
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,038
We've got scores to settle.

546
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,038
Look at this!
He brought a girl!

547
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,039
She's pretty.

548
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:43,381
Shut up! So what?
Half the world is women.

549
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:48,345
That's not just any girl.
She's Piccolo's chief designer.

550
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,223
This cute little thing?

551
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,062
Are you sure?

552
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:59,569
My plane's a lot better than it was.
She's young but she's good.

553
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,566
Really, Porco?

554
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,574
I never lie about planes.

555
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:09,578
She's hereto make sure
I pay the bill.

556
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,074
You're in debt, too?
Serves you right!

557
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:19,372
Bust that plane up so bad,
all he's got left is the loan!

558
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:24,085
You're going to take an axe
to the plane I built?

559
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,379
A plane as beautiful as that?

560
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,092
It's a long story, Miss.

561
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,308
I'll bet!

562
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,099
Well, you know...

563
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,889
And you call yourselves pilots?

564
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:39,270
Where are my shoes?

565
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:52,079
I was raised on stories about
seaplane pilots.

566
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:57,793
My grandpa always said there's
no finer people anywhere.

567
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,415
Their hearts are washed clean
by the sea and sky.

568
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,005
So they're braver than sailors...

569
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,429
and prouder than regular pilots.

570
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,851
That's right. That's us seaplane pilots!

571
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:20,646
The most precious thing to them
isn't money or women, it's honor.

572
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,315
Yeah! That's right, Miss!

573
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,650
Hurray for seaplane pilots!

574
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,986
Play them like a fiddle.

575
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:34,489
All right. We won't take our axes
and bust up the plane you built.

576
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,501
But honor won't let us
just walk away, either.

577
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,827
Mince the pig!

578
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,831
Yeah! Make hamburger out of him!

579
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,216
Don't be so pig-headed!

580
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:50,638
You don't understand!
Haven't you any shame?

581
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,678
You need that American
to save you?

582
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,978
Your mothers would weep.
And tell you to take a bath!

583
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:02,521
Porco's come back to go
one-on-one with Curtiss...

584
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:06,358
for the honor of the seaplane
pilots of the Adriatic!

585
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:10,491
A man without honor or scruples
is nothing. Fight fair!

586
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,199
I always said
we shouldn't hire Curtiss.

587
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,199
Stop trying to weasel out.

588
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,825
What do we do, Boss?

589
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,702
She has a point.

590
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,541
We could lose face here.
Should we talk to Curtiss?

591
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:29,384
Get him to fight the pig again?

592
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,716
But the contract's expired.

593
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,010
This is embarrassing!

594
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,936
It's Curtiss!

595
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,895
I heard you!
I don't run and I don't hide!

596
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:52,358
What idiot put a path up there?

597
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,079
Hold this for me.

598
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,131
So you want a return match?

599
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:18,134
But I already won once.
I'm no one's hired gun now.

600
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,928
So what do you want?

601
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,281
Beautiful!

602
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,447
Will you marry me if I win?

603
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,615
I'm serious.

604
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:46,628
All right. But if Porco wins,
you pay his bills.

605
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,079
Wait, Fio!

606
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,090
You keep out of it.

607
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,968
Speak now or hold your peace, Fio.

608
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,803
It's up to him.

609
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,767
It's a lot of money.

610
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:01,976
It's a bargain!

611
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,762
Yes or no?

612
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,307
I'll gladly fight for the woman I love!

613
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,649
Good!

614
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:13,777
Listen, all of you!
I like this girl's spirit.

615
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:17,489
The Mamma Aiutos will
sponsor this fight!

616
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,829
Count the Federation in!

617
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,169
See you later, Miss Fio!

618
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:31,836
Morons!

619
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,842
Don't forget to show up, pig!

620
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,843
Shut up and get out of here!

621
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,344
See ya!

622
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:48,978
Look what you've gone and
gotten me into!

623
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,858
Don't be angry. I know it was stupid.

624
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,027
Fio?

625
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:04,702
I've got to thank you anyway.

626
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,208
You got me a chance.

627
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:11,706
Thanks. I guess fate meant
for us to be a team.

628
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,832
So we're partners?

629
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:17,836
My chances are only 50-50.

630
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,802
I believe in you.

631
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:27,726
I hate that word, but
it sounds different coming from you.

632
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:37,398
What's the matter?
You're not feeling well?

633
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,066
I'm fine.

634
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:43,362
My heart started beating
so fast I couldn't breathe.

635
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,572
I was really scared.

636
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,872
My knees are all wobbly!

637
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,587
Hey!

638
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,252
I'm going swimming.

639
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,774
Porco, we screwed up!

640
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,153
HOW?

641
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:22,117
We didn't pad the bill.

642
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,449
We blew it!

643
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,582
You're right!

644
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,879
Porco?

645
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,890
What? Can't you sleep?

646
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,639
I could've sworn...

647
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,896
Or was I dreaming?

648
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,026
Go back to sleep.
We're off early tomorrow.

649
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,645
Porco?

650
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,531
Why did you turn into a pig?

651
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,362
It's a long story.

652
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:52,416
My father was in the same unit
with Lieutenant Marco Paggot.

653
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:57,542
I used to love the story of how
he jumped off a cliff...

654
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,664
to rescue an enemy pilot.

655
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,713
Porco! Shall I kiss you?

656
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:13,725
Like the princess who turned
the frog back into a prince?

657
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:18,058
Don't be stupid.
Save it for someone special.

658
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,736
Maybe I'm not the one.

659
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,732
You're a good girl.

660
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:31,037
You make me think
humanity's not a complete waste.

661
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,406
Now be good and go to sleep.

662
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,125
Tell me a story, then I'll sleep.

663
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,912
A story?

664
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,583
Let's see.

665
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,010
It was the last summer of the war.

666
01:06:55,303 --> 01:07:01,561
We were on our usual patrol
over the Adriatic, heading for Istria.

667
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,618
Berlini was my wingman.

668
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:14,580
An old friend, who'd gotten
married two days before.

669
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,627
I was best man at his wedding.

670
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:23,419
But we couldn't get leave,
so we'd come straight back to base.

671
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:47,318
Planes were dropping like flies,
ours and theirs.

672
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:50,317
There were three on my tail.

673
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,494
I had my hands full.

674
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,455
Then I was the only one
left on our side.

675
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:01,620
The enemy kept on coming.
They had blood in their eyes.

676
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:07,505
I was numb, I couldn't see.
I thought I was a goner.

677
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:11,846
Suddenly everything went white
all around me.

678
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,131
White?

679
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:16,055
Like I was in pure light.

680
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:22,350
But a light so strange
I didn't notice I was in cloud.

681
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:27,525
I didn't even have the strength
to hold the stick.

682
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:31,066
But the plane flew itself.

683
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,931
A world above the clouds?

684
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:05,063
Yeah, and dead quiet.
The sky was so beautiful...

685
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:10,564
with this one long contrail
stretching out of sight.

686
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,430
Berlini, you're okay!

687
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,441
Berlini, wait! Where are you going?

688
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,949
Berlini, stop! What about Gina?

689
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,625
I'll go instead!

690
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:50,164
When I came to, I was all alone,
flying just above the waves.

691
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,169
Heaven wasn't ready for you.

692
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:03,010
I think God was telling me
to fly alone forever.

693
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,850
No, Porco! You're a good person!

694
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:11,523
The good ones are all dead.
And maybe what I saw was Hell.

695
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:15,025
End of story. Go to sleep.

696
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,117
That junkyard sold me rusty ammo.

697
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:27,539
I'm glad you came back alive.
I really like you, Porco.

698
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,581
Good night!

699
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:57,071
Place your bets here!

700
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,909
If you're real men, put your money
where your mouths are!

701
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,914
You'd think it was a carnival!

702
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,083
They're all air pirates?

703
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:21,926
The scum of the Mediterranean.
Gangsters, pirates, smugglers...

704
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:25,592
spies, undercover cops,
and a few respectable citizens.

705
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,805
This is going to make me
even more famous!

706
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,608
<i>Ten minutes to start!</i>

707
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:39,615
The showdown between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtiss is about to begin!

708
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:46,120
There's no rules. The first one to
run is a coward forever!

709
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:50,125
Shut up! We came here for
a dogfight, not speeches!

710
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:57,458
Shut up! Open your mouth
and we shoot you!

711
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,014
A ten-ton bomb would be better.

712
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:13,978
This fight decides the fate of
our beloved Miss Fio Piccolo...

713
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,021
who needs no introduction!

714
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:20,780
Know what I mean?
A big hand for Fio! Applaud!

715
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,158
Get on with it!

716
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:27,620
Quiet! There are formalities
to observe!

717
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:31,325
Both sides will place their wagers!

718
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,166
Please sit down.

719
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,335
Thank you.

720
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:40,500
Put it down!

721
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:48,137
No complaints? All right, shake hands
and come out flying!

722
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,056
Forget it. I'll keep my hands clean.

723
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:56,145
That's not very friendly.

724
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,143
We'll go straight to the church!

725
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:04,320
Don't worry. My mother says
you can get used to anything.

726
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,663
May we have a picture?

727
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:12,828
We took a bath!

728
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,826
Smile, everyone!

729
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,376
Smile!

730
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,568
Black wins if it's over
in three minutes!

731
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:45,072
Maybe we could get them
to do this every month!

732
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,411
<i>15 seconds to start.</i>

733
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:56,417
That is so cool!

734
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:58,749
<i>Five seconds...</i>

735
01:14:58,869 --> 01:14:59,745
<i>Four...</i>

736
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:00,746
<i>Three...</i>

737
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:01,747
<i>Two...</i>

738
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:02,589
<i>One...</i>

739
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:03,424
<i>Zero!</i>

740
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,593
Curtiss has the height!

741
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,454
It's all Curtiss so far!

742
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,613
Gimme!

743
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,793
Come on, Porco! Get above him!

744
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,167
He's smart to stay low.

745
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,670
He's harder to hit.

746
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,978
Don't worry! I've got lots of ammo.

747
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,660
A barrel roll. The pig's on his tail!

748
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,828
A barrel roll?

749
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,161
That trick made him
the Ace of the Adriatic!

750
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,333
Damn!

751
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,507
NOW!

752
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:42,147
- He didn't shoot!
- Did his gun jam?

753
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:46,319
He's not going to shoot
until the very end.

754
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:51,700
The pig's not a killer. The American's
still got plenty of ammo!

755
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,029
Now! Shoot!

756
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:56,871
He didn't fire. What did I tell you?

757
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,199
If he shoots now,
he'll hit the American.

758
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:04,875
He's going to wait till he can put
two or three rounds into the engine.

759
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:08,291
The damn fool!
This is no time for sportsmanship.

760
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,587
Porco...

761
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,554
What's wrong with you? Shoot!

762
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:18,889
Or are your guns jammed? Too bad.

763
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,900
Here they come!

764
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:31,402
Come on, fight like a pig!

765
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,780
Not this way! No!

766
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,535
He's coming around!

767
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:54,796
Go fight somewhere else!

768
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,720
Look at those vapor trails!

769
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:12,780
You only see this
once in a lifetime!

770
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,406
This is so moving!

771
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:27,290
If she doesn't hurry she'll miss it.

772
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,127
She won't come out of her room.

773
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:34,002
Are we going or not?
I want to see it too!

774
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,107
<i>F to Gina. Warn pig.</i>

775
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,478
<i>Stop fooling around.
Air Force is coming.</i>

776
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,113
“F”? That's Ferrarin.

777
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,158
Time to go!

778
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:20,506
They're both really tough.

779
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,801
They're just getting warmed up.

780
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,979
Go, Porco!

781
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,981
You stupid pig!

782
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:41,152
You think you can have Fio?

783
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,043
Now the pig's got his tail!

784
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,707
The finale!

785
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,541
Huh?

786
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,053
It's jammed.

787
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,057
You're finished!

788
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,892
What?

789
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,893
Jammed!

790
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:15,061
What's the matter, out of ammo?

791
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:18,940
It's broken.
Fio's big butt!

792
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:24,407
No ties in this game!

793
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:29,416
This isn't a western!
What are you going to hit with that?

794
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,082
You jerk!

795
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:39,260
What's that going to do?
Hi-ho Silver!

796
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,102
You rotten pig!

797
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:52,606
<i>Missed!</i>

798
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,441
Chicken!

799
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:56,560
You ducked!

800
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,937
You don't love her.

801
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,150
Shut up, pig!

802
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,108
Something's wrong.

803
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:03,484
They're coming down!

804
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,452
They're back!

805
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,626
Wait! The prizes stay here!

806
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,875
All right, wait for me!

807
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:27,633
You eat too much!

808
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,474
Cowboy!

809
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,770
Put 'em up.

810
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,980
Go punch a cow!

811
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:49,447
Come on, Porco!

812
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,497
Get up, Pig-

813
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,123
That's dirty!

814
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,529
Uppercut! Block!

815
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,035
Yes! Yes!

816
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:32,865
Yes! The Federation can take bets.

817
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,833
Somebody bring a bell!

818
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,039
Can't you go faster?

819
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,337
No. She'll overheat.

820
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,548
Pilots are all crazy!

821
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:55,187
Fio! Did you see that punch?

822
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:02,232
I'll finish you in the next round.

823
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,279
You're going down.

824
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,899
Stay in there!

825
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:09,410
I'm gonna flatten you, pig.

826
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,239
Come on, pretty boy!

827
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,371
You're the pretty boy here!

828
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,079
Chasing every girl you see!

829
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:21,581
What about you?

830
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,420
Who's it going to be, Fio or Gina?

831
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,093
What was that?

832
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,764
You only get one!

833
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,468
Gina...

834
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,769
Miss Gina to you!

835
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,611
Gina's in love with you!

836
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,281
She sits in that garden...

837
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,122
and waits...

838
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,290
for you to come!

839
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:08,627
Porco!

840
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:09,753
The bell!

841
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,425
Start the count!

842
01:24:12,422 --> 01:24:13,765
Look at him!

843
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,849
The Air Force isn't here yet.

844
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:36,489
Trying to psyche me out, are you?

845
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,833
I don't get you.

846
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,672
It's the truth!

847
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,173
You can't have Fio!

848
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:52,550
That's Gina!

849
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:57,346
There's trouble!

850
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,530
First one to stand wins!

851
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,486
Coming through!

852
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,366
Gina, stop!

853
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,043
Marco, can you hear me?

854
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,046
Are you going to break
another woman's heart?

855
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,556
Porco!

856
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,271
Porco!

857
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,190
Thank you, Porco!

858
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,902
It was nothing.

859
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:02,917
Okay, the party's over.
The Italian Air Force is coming.

860
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,410
Get out of here, everyone.

861
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:09,919
Come to the club.
Drinks are on the house!

862
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,593
We're out of here!

863
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,105
It's over.

864
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,274
Boss! Hurry!

865
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:33,489
There are formalities to observe!

866
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:39,950
I hate the pig, but I like you.
Build some good planes.

867
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,287
Bye!

868
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:44,409
Thanks. Take a bath sometime!

869
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,953
Thanks, Mr. Curtiss!

870
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:51,298
Next time it won't be a bet.
I'll court you for real.

871
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,634
Sure. But I've made up my mind.

872
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,637
You ride in Gina's plane.

873
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,301
No!

874
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,934
I ride in your plane!
We're partners, aren't we?

875
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:08,266
Gina, take this girl
back to the regular world.

876
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,983
You always do this. It's not fair.

877
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,158
Sorry. Off you go.

878
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,448
Take her up.

879
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:58,694
Here comes the cavalry.

880
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:02,361
Help me draw them away.

881
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,572
Hey, your face! Wait!

882
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:07,700
Show me your face!

883
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,201
Your plane's over there!

884
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:10,578
Just one look!

885
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:25,886
<i>I never saw Porco again,
even after the Air Force gave up...</i>

886
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,059
<i>and I went back to Milan.</i>

887
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:35,228
<i>But Gina and I
became good friends.</i>

888
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:44,450
<i>And we still are, through all the war
and turmoil since then.</i>

889
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:53,918
<i>Now I run Piccolo Co., but I still
summer at the Hotel Adriano.</i>

890
01:28:55,247 --> 01:29:00,094
<i>Gina is more beautiful every year,
and there are lots of old faces.</i>

891
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:07,601
<i>Oh, yes. Mr. Curtiss isn't
President yet, but he writes us...</i>

892
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:12,644
<i>saying he misses the good old days
of that Adriatic summer.</i>

893
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:19,777
<i>And did Gina win her bet?
That's our secret.</i>

894
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:35,246
