{2858}{2905}Get up, get up!
{3014}{3064}Mixed up in that beating on 12th Street?
{3066}{3097}No, plain drunkenness.
{3102}{3139}It says he was picked up there.
{3141}{3200}They had him on the carpet|down at headquarters.
{3205}{3253}He's clear. Plain drunkenness.
{3258}{3282}All right.
{3294}{3317}Fill it up.
{3319}{3349}Can I keep it?
{3366}{3439}Okay. You want to lean him|against something?
{3450}{3506}- Stand him over there.|- Come on.
{3940}{3964}Judy?
{3979}{4015}We're ready for you now.
{4442}{4478}He must hate me.
{4483}{4507}What?
{4559}{4601}He hates me.
{4632}{4670}What makes you think so?
{4700}{4754}I don't think. I know.
{4798}{4834}He looks at me like...
{4848}{4910}I was the ugliest thing in the world.
{4936}{4978}He doesn't like my friends.
{4983}{5038}He doesn't like one thing about me.
{5055}{5100}And he called me....
{5158}{5216}He called me a dirty tramp!
{5242}{5290}My own father!
{5333}{5377}Do you think he really means that?
{5383}{5417}Yes!
{5423}{5454}No!
{5469}{5512}I don't know.
{5600}{5683}I mean, maybe he doesn't mean it...
{5688}{5742}but he acts like he does.
{5774}{5814}We were all together.
{5827}{5890}And we were going to celebrate Easter.
{5916}{5978}And we were going to catch a double bill.
{6022}{6054}Big deal!
{6082}{6134}So I put on my new dress...
{6166}{6206}and I came out...
{6230}{6278}and he grabbed my face...
{6299}{6375}and he started rubbing off all the lipstick.
{6458}{6514}I thought he'd rub off my lips.
{6542}{6594}And I ran out of that house.
{6598}{6662}Is that why you were|wandering around at 1:00 a.m.?
{6752}{6785}Not looking for company?
{6827}{6894}I don't even know why I do it.
{6906}{6958}Maybe you get back at your dad that way.
{6960}{7030}If you're not as close to him|as you'd like to be...
{7040}{7117}maybe this is one way|of making him pay attention.
{7122}{7153}Did you think of that?
{7188}{7255}I'll never get close to anybody.
{7280}{7328}Would you go home if we can arrange it?
{7467}{7511}What's your number, Judy?
{7520}{7580}We'll ask your dad|to come and pick you up.
{7586}{7645}Unless you really don't want to go home.
{7680}{7722}Would you rather stay here?
{7931}{7990}Lexington 0-5-5-4-9.
{8370}{8423}That's enough static out of you!
{8623}{8676}Cut it out now. I'm warning you!
{8769}{8842}You're shivering, John. Are you cold?
{8973}{9007}Want my jacket?
{9190}{9224}Want my jacket?
{9232}{9266}It's warm.
{9638}{9679}Your mother will pick you up.
{9686}{9706}What?
{9714}{9768}Your mother will be down to pick you up.
{9774}{9805}My mother!
{9812}{9852}She's being called for.
{9882}{9938}You said you'd call my father!
{9958}{10009}Goodbye, Judy. And take it easy.
{10022}{10053}Oh, sure!
{10368}{10391}John Crawford?
{10393}{10417}Yes, sir?
{10426}{10462}Come with me, John.
{10697}{10723}Jim!
{10921}{10955}Happy Easter.
{10976}{11010}Happy Easter.
{11020}{11061}Where were you tonight?
{11066}{11125}They called us,|and I got the fright of my life!
{11127}{11176}Where were you tonight, Jimbo?
{11414}{11460}Well, then, there now.
{11487}{11538}Were you having a ball, Dad?
{11594}{11654}Well, everybody's been having a ball.
{11754}{11807}You're the king of the ball, Dad.
{11999}{12043}You think I'm funny?
{12397}{12448}Why didn't you take my jacket?
{12465}{12495}Jim Stark?
{12736}{12760}John.
{12812}{12836}John!
{12914}{12981}Do you have any idea|why you shot those puppies?
{13018}{13086}Is that what they call you,|or do you have a nickname?
{13110}{13130}Plato.
{13135}{13182}He was a Greek philosopher.
{13208}{13300}You talk nice to the man now, hear?|He's going to help you.
{13339}{13377}Nobody can help me.
{13384}{13442}Can you tell me why|you killed those puppies?
{13480}{13509}No, sir.
{13559}{13609}Where'd you get the gun?
{13646}{13676}My mother's drawer.
{13695}{13745}Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
{13764}{13786}She's away.
{13792}{13845}She's always going away somewhere.
{13850}{13930}She's got a sister in Chicago,|and she's there for the holiday.
{13941}{13970}Where's your father?
{13972}{14014}They're not together, sir.
{14024}{14086}We haven't seen him now in a long time.
{14115}{14150}Do you ever hear from him?
{14155}{14239}I don't think it's right for a mother|to go and leave her child.
{14244}{14291}It's his birthday today, sir.
{14343}{14398}Did the boy ever talk to a psychiatrist?
{14442}{14479}You mean a head shrinker?
{14500}{14562}Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them, sir.
{14583}{14628}Maybe she'd better start.
{14634}{14685}Sit over there for just a minute, please.
{14832}{14914}I don't see what's so bad|about taking a little drink.
{14918}{14954}You don't?
{14960}{14986}He's a minor...
{14990}{15057}and it looks like he had more|than a "little drink."
{15078}{15112}Don't hum, dear.
{15123}{15191}I cut loose pretty good in my day too.
{15196}{15222}Really, Frank?
{15233}{15257}When was that?
{15259}{15308}Can't you wait till we get home?
{15313}{15338}How about you?
{15344}{15389}Got anything to say for yourself?
{15421}{15453}Not interested?
{15466}{15506}Can't you answer?
{15511}{15545}What's the matter with you?
{15547}{15587}He's just loaded, honey.
{15592}{15643}I was talking to Jim!
{15650}{15744}Well, I'd like to just explain.|You see, we just moved here...
{15749}{15813}and the kid hasn't got any friends.
{15818}{15854}Tell him why we moved here.
{15858}{15889}Will you hold it?
{15894}{15930}Tell the man why we moved.
{15934}{15986}- Will you hold it!|- You can't protect me.
{15994}{16100}Do you mind if I try? Do you|have to slam the door in my face?
{16115}{16188}I try to get to him. What happens?
{16193}{16268}I buy you everything you want.|A bicycle? You get it!
{16273}{16324}- A car...|- You buy me many things.
{16329}{16380}Not just buying!
{16385}{16435}We give you love and affection, don't we?
{16437}{16469}Then what is it?
{16474}{16521}Was it because we went to that party?
{16526}{16622}You know what kind of drunken brawls|those kind of parties turn into.
{16632}{16661}It's no place for kids!
{16663}{16728}A minute ago,|you said you didn't care if he drinks.
{16733}{16778}He said a "little" drink.
{16788}{16858}You're tearing me apart!
{16894}{16990}You say one thing, he says another,|and everybody changes back again!
{17009}{17044}That's a fine way to behave!
{17046}{17106}Well, you know who he takes after.
{17259}{17293}Inside, Jim.
{17334}{17355}Come on.
{17366}{17390}Inside.
{17423}{17476}- Excuse us a minute.|- Yeah, sure.
{17623}{17694}Somebody ought to put poison|in her Epsom salts.
{17708}{17734}Grandma?
{17758}{17790}Get lost.
{17802}{17862}Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.
{17928}{17980}Why don't you wash up and go home?
{17994}{18030}This is cute.
{18052}{18102}Big, tough character!
{18115}{18162}You don't kid me, pal.
{18176}{18229}How come you're not wearing your boots?
{18274}{18309}Well, that's cute.
{18369}{18398}That's cute.
{18746}{18794}It's too bad you didn't connect.
{18833}{18886}You could have gone to juvenile hall.
{18922}{18962}That's what you want, isn't it?
{19023}{19055}Sure, it is.
{19109}{19170}You want to bug us|till we have to lock you up.
{19186}{19207}Why?
{19212}{19251}- Leave me alone.|- No.
{19302}{19329}I don't know why.
{19331}{19372}Go on, don't give me that!
{19382}{19478}Please, lock me up. I'll hit somebody.|I'll do something, and I don't....
{19540}{19567}Try the desk.
{19666}{19690}Go ahead.
{20593}{20662}Is that why you moved?|You were in trouble?
{20698}{20732}No, they think...
{20779}{20858}that they can protect me|by moving around all the time.
{20873}{20961}You had a good start in the wrong|direction. Why'd you do it?
{21001}{21030}What do you mean?
{21054}{21091}Mess a kid up?
{21218}{21250}He called me chicken.
{21287}{21328}Your folks didn't understand?
{21381}{21415}They never do.
{21536}{21594}They think that I can make friends...
{21622}{21646}if we move.
{21754}{21835}Just move. Everything|will be roses and sunshine.
{21846}{21902}But you don't think|that's the right solution?
{21989}{22053}She eats him alive and he takes it.
{22062}{22110}Things pretty rough for you at home?
{22150}{22178}That's a zoo!
{22190}{22214}What?
{22253}{22286}That's a zoo!
{22346}{22411}I mean, he always wants to be my pal,|you know?
{22455}{22523}But how can I give him anything if he's....
{22589}{22681}I mean, I love him and all that type of stuff.
{22728}{22771}I don't want to hurt him.
{22786}{22869}But then I don't know what to do anymore.
{22874}{22929}Except maybe die.
{22934}{23026}If he had guts to knock Mom cold once...
{23032}{23110}then maybe she'd be happy|and she'd stop picking on him.
{23127}{23187}Because they make mush out of him!
{23206}{23275}You know, just mush!
{23354}{23438}I'll tell you one thing,|I don't ever want to be like him.
{23460}{23480}Chicken?
{23505}{23563}I'll bet you see right through me,|don't you?
{23671}{23742}How can a guy grow up|in a circus like that?
{23750}{23786}Beats me, Jim.
{23818}{23848}But they do.
{23857}{23888}Want some water?
{24042}{24098}If I had one day...
{24222}{24284}when I didn't have to be all confused...
{24328}{24415}and I didn't have to feel|that I was ashamed of everything....
{24438}{24492}If I felt that I belonged someplace....
{24497}{24541}You know? Then....
{24684}{24730}Will you do something for me?
{24795}{24901}If the pot starts boiling again,|will you see me before you get in a jam?
{24926}{25001}If you want to talk,|come in and shoot the breeze.
{25020}{25082}It's easier sometimes|than talking to your folks.
{25198}{25244}Anytime, night or day.
{25422}{25516}You calmed down enough|to go back in there now?
{25577}{25618}Are you serious?
{25806}{25838}Mother, I'm sorry.
{25842}{25887}It's all right, darling.
{25896}{25926}Mister Officer...
{25933}{25982}this was all very unfortunate.
{25986}{26078}He made a mistake, and he's sorry,|so we won't have any more trouble.
{26089}{26143}He was always a lovely boy.
{26148}{26234}Grandmother, you tell one more lie|and you'll turn to stone.
{26320}{26344}Look, Jim...
{26349}{26378}don't forget.
{26397}{26449}Have some cigars?
{26468}{26504}No, thanks. I don't smoke.
{26509}{26543}Give them to your friends.
{26545}{26578}No, thanks, Mr. Stark.
{26580}{26630}Frank, he doesn't want any.
{26798}{26866}Jim, your eggs are on the table, dear.
{26973}{27016}Sit down. Eat. You'll be late.
{27038}{27062}Beau!
{27193}{27229}Come here, Beau!
{27271}{27306}Beau, come on!
{27327}{27381}I don't think I want anything.
{27416}{27440}I'm nervous.
{27446}{27512}My first day of school,|Mother made me eat so much...
{27517}{27560}I couldn't swallow until recess.
{27571}{27609}Did you fix any sandwiches?
{27622}{27670}There's meatloaf and peanut butter...
{27754}{27810}What did I tell you? Peanut butter.
{27870}{27915}There's a thermos of orange juice...
{27920}{27972}and some applesauce cake to go with it.
{27977}{28009}And I baked it.
{28157}{28182}Goodbye, Mom.
{28187}{28279}Young fellow, you knock them dead|like your old man used to.
{28312}{28350}You know what I think?
{28355}{28416}I feel maybe we'll stay here awhile.
{28430}{28498}Listen, watch out|about choosing your pals.
{28503}{28538}Don't let them choose you.
{28910}{28934}Wait a minute.
{29188}{29220}I've seen you before.
{29226}{29294}- Stop the world!|- You don't have to be unfriendly.
{29298}{29338}Well, now that's true.
{29351}{29400}But life is crushing in on me.
{29405}{29459}Life can be beautiful.
{29544}{29611}- I know where it was.|- Where what was?
{29649}{29688}Where I first saw you.
{29727}{29777}Everything going okay now?
{29824}{29860}You live here, don't you?
{29881}{29912}Who lives?
{29934}{29973}Hey, where's Dawson High?
{29978}{30023}At University and Tenth.
{30041}{30061}Thanks.
{30078}{30122}You want to carry my books?
{30170}{30233}I got my car. You want to go with me?
{30242}{30281}I go with the kids.
{30355}{30378}I'll bet.
{30550}{30578}All right.
{30612}{30697}You know, I bet you're a real yo-yo.
{30790}{30830}I love you too.
{31030}{31057}What's that?
{31132}{31200}- That's a new disease.|- Friend of yours?
{31205}{31258}- Glad they let you out.|- Nobody chickened.
{31279}{31340}- You're lucky he lived.|- They always live.
{31349}{31389}Man, I'm living!
{31478}{31527}Hey, which way to University and Tenth?
{31532}{31598}Which way is it to University and Tenth?
{31607}{31662}- It's that way!|- No, it's that way!
{33123}{33150}Hey, watch it!
{33168}{33215}Where do you think you're going?
{33250}{33332}You stepped on the school insignia.|Nobody does that, ever!
{33337}{33383}I'm sorry. It's my first day here...
{33385}{33434}and nobody told me about it.
{33439}{33482}- I'm very sorry.|- It's okay.
{33487}{33517}Know where to report?
{33530}{33558}Mr. Bassett.
{33594}{33659}Room 208. He'll show you where to go.
{33664}{33697}I'm sorry about that.
{33702}{33746}Just watch it next time.
{35650}{35702}and immensity of our universe.
{35706}{35768}For many days|before the end of our Earth...
{35779}{35855}people will look|into the night sky and notice a star...
{35860}{35931}increasingly bright and increasingly near.
{35936}{35980}As this star approaches us...
{36026}{36055}Jim Stark.
{36082}{36125}I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.
{36127}{36201}As this star approaches us,|the weather will change.
{36211}{36311}The great polar fields of the north|and south will rot and divide.
{36316}{36374}And the seas will turn warmer.
{36387}{36460}The last of us search the heavens|and stand amazed.
{36465}{36524}For the stars will still be there...
{36529}{36588}moving through their ancient rhythms.
{36601}{36668}The familiar constellations|that illuminate our night...
{36670}{36722}will seem as they have always seemed:
{36724}{36796}Eternal, unchanged and little moved...
{36801}{36882}by the shortness of time|between our planet's birth and demise.
{36922}{36964}Orion, the hunter.
{36969}{37008}One of Ptolemy's constellations...
{37010}{37066}and the most brilliant in the heavens.
{37070}{37090}Boy!
{37146}{37174}What?
{37213}{37251}I was just thinking that...
{37256}{37325}once you've been up there|you know you been some place.
{37417}{37453}Gesundheit!
{37478}{37525}They're almost equal in brilliancy.
{37566}{37608}Cancer, the crab...
{37613}{37720}containing a large, loose cluster of stars,|called Praesepe or the Beehive.
{37754}{37789}I'm a crab!
{37845}{37909}The sun can be vertically overhead.
{38008}{38054}Taurus, the bull.
{38257}{38295}That's real funny.
{38348}{38380}A comedian, Buzz.
{38393}{38450}He's cute. I bet he's real rough too.
{38465}{38506}I bet he fights cows.
{38690}{38737}You shouldn't monkey with him.
{38763}{38810}- He's a wheel.|- Who?
{38815}{38842}Buzz.
{38853}{38890}So is she.
{38914}{38974}It's hard to make friends with these guys.
{39029}{39072}I don't want to make friends.
{39112}{39156}And while the flash of our beginning...
{39158}{39235}has not yet traveled|the light years into distance...
{39240}{39334}has not yet been seen by planets|deep within the other galaxies...
{39338}{39431}we will disappear into the blackness|of the space from which we came...
{39436}{39544}destroyed as we began,|in a burst of gas and fire.
{40005}{40086}The heavens are still and cold once more.
{40107}{40205}In all the immensity of our universe|and the galaxies beyond...
{40210}{40260}the Earth will not be missed.
{40266}{40317}Through the infinite reaches of space...
{40319}{40406}the problems of man seem|trivial and naive indeed.
{40422}{40493}And man, existing alone...
{40498}{40568}seems himself an episode|of little consequence.
{40582}{40613}That's all.
{40622}{40675}Thank you for your attention.
{40682}{40722}Thank you very much.
{40813}{40889}May I have your attention?|May I please have your attention?
{40894}{40990}Classes will meet at the busses outside.|May I have your attention?
{40995}{41046}May I have your attention?
{41054}{41090}Oh, what the heck!
{41478}{41520}It's all over. The world ended.
{41550}{41603}What does he know about man alone?
{42025}{42073}Certainly is a lot of switches.
{42079}{42121}Yeah, quite intricate.
{42137}{42212}- Hey, what's for kicks?|- What do you say, Buzz?
{42217}{42256}Well, what do you want to do?
{42270}{42329}- How about Moo?|- You mean the guy in there?
{42334}{42378}- The comedian.|- What do you say?
{42393}{42445}All right! What do you want to do?
{42450}{42491}Let's bring him down.
{42506}{42540}He'd make a good pigeon.
{42550}{42642}- What's the funny guy doing?|- The guy in back of us, Buzz.
{42647}{42704}He ought to have his wardrobe|cleaned and burned.
{42706}{42759}- All right, Moo.|- All right.
{42790}{42842}- What will we do with him?|- Don't worry.
{42847}{42910}I'll figure out what we'll do with him.
{42928}{42978}Relax. He'll figure it out.
{43958}{43993}What are you looking at?
{44014}{44041}Nothing.
{44332}{44415}I told you not to fool with those guys.|Now they're laying for you.
{44417}{44483}If you don't want trouble,|I know where we can go.
{44488}{44517}It's a big mansion.
{44677}{44708}There it is.
{44723}{44777}We could sneak around|and they wouldn't know.
{44779}{44846}- Who lives there?|- Nobody lives there.
{44857}{44893}Come on, let's go!
{44938}{44960}There he is.
{45237}{45260}That's his car.
{46395}{46426}Relax, man.
{47942}{47980}- You know something?|- No, what?
{47982}{48030}You read too many comic books.
{48051}{48142}Well, he's real abstract! He's different.
{48146}{48179}That's right.
{48246}{48287}I'm cute too.
{48373}{48407}Is that meaning me?
{48418}{48454}- Is that meaning me?|- What?
{48459}{48489}Chicken!
{48505}{48527}Yes.
{48545}{48582}You shouldn't call me that.
{48816}{48850}How about you?
{48923}{48972}Are you always at ringside?
{48998}{49058}What are you hanging around|such rank company for?
{49150}{49173}What?
{49250}{49286}I don't want any trouble.
{49290}{49332}The blade game, Buzz?
{49468}{49524}I thought only punks fought with knives.
{49534}{49570}Who's fighting?
{49575}{49636}No fighting. It's examination time, man.
{49641}{49693}It's a crazy game.
{49730}{49760}Get him a knife.
{49826}{49856}Give it to him.
{49909}{49947}Come on, give him a knife.
{49951}{50001}- Pick it up!|- I don't want any trouble.
{50018}{50040}Pick it up!
{50193}{50218}Pick it up!
{50399}{50441}Now, you understand the action?
{50450}{50495}There's no sticking.
{50522}{50553}Crunch?
{50651}{50673}Just...
{50687}{50745}a little jabbing. That's all.
{50778}{50824}What's the matter?
{50865}{50902}What's the matter?
{50907}{50995}What're you waiting on, toreador?|I thought you wanted a little action.
{51067}{51137}- Are you crumb chicken or...|- Don't call me that!
{51217}{51241}Toro!
{52210}{52270}Cut off a button and|you get to join the club.
{52275}{52305}Oh, that's close!
{52485}{52529}Look out, Buzz! He's got a chain!
{52757}{52785}Dr. Minton!
{52968}{53034}All right, you asked for it, you've got it.
{53060}{53102}- What is it?|- Trouble.
{53130}{53183}Are you satisfied or|do you want some more?
{53335}{53369}There's your audience.
{53374}{53406}I don't think so.
{53421}{53444}Let's split, Buzz.
{53446}{53509}Split for what?|A couple of old poopheads?
{53633}{53686}Now, you say the word and you're dead.
{53702}{53729}You're cold.
{53734}{53799}I'll meet you someplace,|but not with those things.
{53816}{53855}That's trouble.
{53922}{53992}How then? You know the Millertown bluff?
{53998}{54060}The bluff?|Hey, Buzz, that's dangerous up there.
{54086}{54191}Cookie, get some cars, and we'll have|some kicks tonight about 8:00.
{54196}{54239}- All right.|- We'll have a chickie-run.
{54241}{54270}Sounds good. Fine.
{54275}{54319}You ever been in a chickie-run?
{54346}{54382}That's all I ever do.
{54402}{54459}Come on, all of you. Start moving!
{54464}{54492}Come on, get going.
{54494}{54546}Oh, you don't mean little old us?
{54550}{54608}What's the matter with the nice man?
{54642}{54689}We were just cutting out!
{54712}{54737}Eight o'clock?
{54747}{54782}Yeah.
{54819}{54844}Okay.
{55100}{55158}Plato, what is a chickie-run?
{55933}{55958}Mom?
{56027}{56093}Hi, Jimbo. You thought I was Mom?
{56165}{56185}Yeah.
{56192}{56277}Well, the girl's out.|I was getting Mom some supper.
{56284}{56335}She doesn't feel too well.
{56386}{56422}What'd you do, drop it?
{56434}{56462}You dropped it?
{56641}{56676}- That's funny.|- I know it.
{56678}{56768}- I'll clean up before she sees it.|- Let her see it.
{56832}{56858}Let her see it!
{56886}{56930}What can happen? She's...
{57050}{57074}Dad?
{57414}{57458}Stand. Don't...
{57474}{57520}I mean, you shouldn't...
{57789}{57814}Beau?
{57939}{57966}Daddy?
{57999}{58041}Haven't you forgotten something?
{58123}{58158}What's the matter with you?
{58164}{58258}You're too old for that stuff.|I thought you'd stopped that long ago.
{58316}{58353}I didn't want to stop.
{58374}{58435}- Didn't want to stop what?|- Nothing, nothing.
{58452}{58479}I was talking to Dad.
{58481}{58546}I didn't kiss her, so it's a big thing.
{58566}{58614}Bertha, you may serve the souffle.
{58619}{58652}It's fish souffle.
{58674}{58762}You don't have to stand, darling.|Sit down and have your tomato juice.
{58817}{58878}I guess I just don't understand anything.
{58890}{58958}I'm tired. I'd like to change the subject.
{58972}{59001}Why?
{59006}{59050}I'd just like to, that's all!
{59055}{59140}Girls your age don't do things like that!|You need an explanation?
{59158}{59191}Hi, rascal!
{59222}{59263}Girls don't love their father?
{59276}{59306}Since when?
{59318}{59360}Since I got to be 16?
{59389}{59434}Stop that! Sit down!
{59531}{59581}May I please be excused?
{59697}{59734}Hey, glamour puss!
{59741}{59812}I'm sorry. We'll break the date.|We'll stay home.
{59827}{59864}This isn't my home!
{60078}{60114}I don't know what to do.
{60118}{60177}All of a sudden she's a problem.
{60189}{60267}She'll outgrow it, dear. It's just the age.
{60272}{60310}The atomic age!
{60461}{60528}It's just the age when nothing fits.
{60859}{60886}Hey, Jimbo?
{60962}{60992}- You awake?|- Dad?
{61017}{61051}Can I ask you something?
{61056}{61093}Sure.
{61167}{61188}Shoot.
{61202}{61278}Suppose you had to do something.
{61334}{61370}You had to go someplace...
{61395}{61446}and do this thing that was...
{61462}{61513}you know, it was very dangerous.
{61541}{61593}But it was a matter of honor.
{61650}{61692}And you had to prove it.
{61709}{61738}What would you do?
{61764}{61842}Well, is there some kind of trick answer?
{61855}{61905}No, what would you do?
{61923}{61994}Well, I wouldn't make a hasty decision.
{62003}{62034}Tell you what, Jimbo.
{62039}{62110}Let's get a little light on the subject.
{62318}{62343}Blood.
{62410}{62446}Jim, what happened?
{62450}{62512}What kind of trouble are you in?
{62586}{62656}The kind I was telling you about.|Now can you answer me?
{62702}{62754}Nobody can make a snap decision.
{62758}{62817}It's one of those things that you....|You can't.
{62822}{62861}That's all there is to it.
{62884}{62942}It's something that you.... You just don't.
{63046}{63126}We've got to consider|all the pros and cons.
{63136}{63170}I don't have time.
{63174}{63205}We'll make time.
{63210}{63258}I'll get paper and we'll make a list.
{63262}{63307}And then if we're still stuck...
{63319}{63372}we'll get some advice.
{63497}{63552}What can you do|when you have to be a man?
{63561}{63589}Well....
{63610}{63656}No, you give me a direct answer!
{63663}{63714}Are you going to keep me from going?
{63728}{63777}Did I ever stop you from anything?
{63794}{63830}You're at a wonderful age.
{63832}{63905}In ten years, you'll look back|on this and wish...
{63910}{63945}Ten years?
{63982}{64044}I want an answer now. I need one.
{64066}{64174}Listen, Jimbo, I'm just trying|to show you how foolish you are.
{64179}{64252}When you're older,|you'll look back at this...
{64257}{64306}and you'll laugh at yourself...
{64310}{64386}for thinking that this is so important.
{64402}{64450}It's not as if you were alone.
{64455}{64520}This has happened to every boy.
{64537}{64635}It happened to me when I was your age,|maybe a year older.
{64743}{64774}What's all the excitement?
{64776}{64841}I've been working hard|getting this house in order...
{64843}{64878}Jim had blood on him.
{64883}{64953}- He just ran out.|- And you didn't stop him?
{66178}{66217}Hey, Chicken Little!
{66222}{66274}Where's toreador? He beg off?
{66278}{66329}He's not scared of you.
{66420}{66475}- There he is.|- Over there, man.
{66597}{66659}- How did you get here?|- I hitched.
{66688}{66757}I bet you'd go to a hanging, wouldn't you?
{66762}{66824}I guess it's just my morbid personality.
{66870}{66895}Should I leave?
{66897}{66929}No, it's okay.
{67317}{67373}Come on. Let's go see what we're driving.
{67623}{67662}No, just him.
{67667}{67712}It's okay. Stay here.
{67780}{67827}What did you say your name was?
{67854}{67887}Jim Stark.
{67892}{67951}Yeah, I'm Buzz Gunderson.
{68022}{68066}I got some goodies for you.
{68070}{68110}You got a flashlight?
{68222}{68264}Is he a friend of yours?
{68375}{68421}Yeah, he's my best friend.
{68457}{68490}What's he like?
{68566}{68604}I don't know.
{68619}{68658}You have to get to know him.
{68682}{68716}He doesn't say much.
{68721}{68774}But when he does, you know he means it.
{68781}{68816}He's sincere.
{68842}{68884}Well, that's the main thing.
{68890}{68946}- You want to flip?|- Yeah, go ahead.
{69021}{69049}Heads.
{69114}{69208}Maybe next summer, he'll take me|hunting with him. And fishing.
{69228}{69320}I want him to teach me because|I know he won't get mad if I goof.
{69346}{69378}His name's Jim.
{69383}{69460}It's really James, but he likes Jim more.
{69494}{69575}And people he really likes,|he lets them call him Jamie.
{69592}{69621}Jamie?
{69654}{69688}Try the doors.
{69770}{69814}Hey, try it with the jump.
{70466}{70505}That's the edge.
{70541}{70566}That's the end.
{70666}{70702}Certainly is.
{70793}{70829}You know something?
{70891}{70928}I like you.
{70962}{70995}You know that?
{71039}{71074}Why do we do this?
{71079}{71130}You got to do something...
{71138}{71172}now, don't you?
{72036}{72081}Take them up all the way to the end.
{72086}{72120}Get all the girls!
{72141}{72183}Bring it up to the left side.
{72293}{72339}Crunch, line them up!
{72352}{72422}Go to the end and|bring your cars up on the right.
{72426}{72480}Put your car on the left-hand side.
{72485}{72540}Turn your lights in toward the center.
{72545}{72578}Let's line them up!
{72582}{72618}Moose, come here.
{72622}{72702}Straighten them out.|Tell them when to turn on their lights.
{72706}{72741}Johnny!
{72746}{72807}Follow that dark roadster over there.
{73080}{73102}You're okay?
{73106}{73138}Give me some dirt.
{73350}{73384}Hey, toreador!
{73441}{73470}She signals...
{73474}{73520}we head for the edge.
{73533}{73586}And the first man who jumps is a chicken.
{73598}{73630}All right?
{74162}{74193}Me too.
{74254}{74313}May I have some dirt, please?
{75279}{75326}Hit your lights!
{77597}{77620}Where's Buzz?
{77622}{77658}Down there.
{77807}{77842}Let's get out of here!
{78020}{78045}Down there.
{78050}{78095}Down there is Buzz!
{79658}{79694}This is fine.
{79966}{80001}You'll be all right?
{80338}{80377}You want to see a monkey?
{81202}{81275}Want to come home with me?|There's nobody at my house.
{81280}{81332}Heck, I'm not tired. Are you?
{81337}{81394}I don't have too many people I can talk to.
{81399}{81433}Who has?
{81446}{81493}If you want to come, we could talk...
{81498}{81564}then we could have breakfast,|like my dad used to.
{81566}{81610}If only you could've been my dad...
{81612}{81646}You flipped or something?
{81651}{81678}Look.
{81726}{81784}I'll see you in the morning, okay?
{81792}{81857}I've got to pick up my scooter anyway,|you know.
{81862}{81892}I know.
{82020}{82054}See you tomorrow.
{82729}{82783}Hello, little cute sister.
{82814}{82910}Hello, darling, baby-pie,|glamour puss, sweetie.
{83034}{83074}You belong in bed.
{85586}{85622}He's home!
{85629}{85666}You're home!
{85829}{85854}You're home.
{85858}{85899}Are you all right?
{85904}{85951}Where were you? We were so worried.
{85991}{86050}I wouldn't take a sleeping pill|till you were home.
{86052}{86122}Can I talk to you guys?|I have to talk to somebody.
{86254}{86314}You better give me an answer this time.
{86318}{86354}Go ahead.
{86361}{86408}A direct answer.
{86434}{86474}I'm in trouble.
{86480}{86545}You know that big,|high bluff near Millertown?
{86550}{86595}Yes, there was a bad accident there.
{86600}{86676}They showed the pictures on television.
{86698}{86722}I was in it.
{86724}{86748}How can you...
{86753}{86815}It doesn't matter how.|I was driving a stolen car.
{86817}{86912}That's a fine thing! Do you enjoy|doing this to me, or what?
{86917}{86987}- You wanted him to make a list!|- Let him tell it!
{86992}{87029}She doesn't care!
{87034}{87114}You remember how I almost died|giving birth to him?
{87119}{87196}- And then you say I don't care!|- Please relax, relax!
{87322}{87348}Dad...
{87372}{87442}I said it was a matter of honor.
{87454}{87480}Remember?
{87554}{87598}They called me chicken.
{87638}{87698}You know? Chicken?
{87806}{87843}I had to go.
{88075}{88154}If I didn't, I'd never be able|to face those kids again.
{88274}{88327}I got in one of those cars...
{88339}{88417}and Buzz, one of those kids,|he got in the other car...
{88422}{88478}and we had to drive fast...
{88486}{88552}and then jump before the car|came to the edge.
{88557}{88618}And I got out okay and Buzz didn't.
{88688}{88730}And it killed him.
{88734}{88782}I can't keep it to myself anymore.
{88786}{88831}You just get it off your chest.
{88836}{88899}That is not what I mean!
{88942}{89004}I have never done anything right.
{89009}{89090}I've been going around with|my head in a sling for years.
{89106}{89187}I don't want to drag you into this,|but I can't help it.
{89192}{89228}You see, I think...
{89258}{89374}you can't just go around proving|things and pretending like you're tough.
{89379}{89403}That's right.
{89408}{89482}And even though you got to|look a certain way...
{89487}{89550}- You're absolutely right!|- You look, you feel....
{89555}{89610}You're not listening to me!
{89622}{89688}You're involved in this, just like I am!
{89717}{89794}I'm going to the police|and telling them I'm involved.
{89798}{89827}Did anyone see you?
{89832}{89901}- Did anyone see your license plate?|- I don't know!
{89906}{89957}Will the others go to the police?
{89962}{90010}It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
{90015}{90088}- Why be the only one involved?|- Far be it from me...
{90093}{90157}Do we have to listen to a sermon now?
{90162}{90207}I'm telling him what you mean.
{90212}{90296}You can't be idealistic all your life.|Nobody thanks you for...
{90301}{90374}- Except to yourself!|- Wait a minute!
{90378}{90418}Except yourself.
{90458}{90490}You don't want me to go?
{90519}{90574}No, I don't want you to go to the police.
{90578}{90638}Why should you be the only one involved?
{90643}{90735}But I am involved! We are all involved!
{90774}{90854}A boy, a kid was killed tonight!
{90871}{90939}I can't get out of it and|pretend it didn't happen!
{90944}{91018}Well, you know|that you did the wrong thing.
{91022}{91081}- That's the main thing.|- That's nothing.
{91086}{91152}That is absolutely nothing. Dad, you said...
{91157}{91236}you want me to tell the truth.|Didn't you say that?
{91340}{91377}You can't turn it off.
{91382}{91473}He's not saying that.|He's saying just don't volunteer!
{91492}{91534}Just tell a little white lie.
{91538}{91609}You'll learn! When you're older, Jim.
{91627}{91705}Well, I don't think|that I want to learn that way.
{91710}{91776}It doesn't matter anyway,|because we're moving!
{91792}{91826}Don't tear me loose again.
{91830}{91894}- Just why are we moving?|- Must I spell it out?
{91898}{91964}- You won't use me as an excuse again!|- I don't!
{91969}{92022}When you can't face yourself|you blame me!
{92026}{92061}That is not true!
{92081}{92142}You say it's because of me|or the neighborhood!
{92146}{92211}You use every other phony excuse!
{92226}{92305}Mom, I just....|Once, I want to do something right!
{92310}{92381}And I don't want you|to run away from me again!
{92460}{92548}- This is all going too fast.|- You better give me something.
{92553}{92605}You better give me something fast.
{92610}{92649}Jimmy, you're very young.
{92654}{92718}A foolish decision now|could wreck your whole life!
{92723}{92802}- In ten years you won't know it happened.|- Dad, answer her.
{92845}{92875}Tell her.
{92916}{92954}Ten years.
{93009}{93063}Dad, let me hear you answer her.
{93401}{93447}Dad, stand up for me.
{93710}{93746}Stand up!
{93794}{93822}You'll kill him!
{93890}{93920}You're killing him!
{93931}{93974}You want to kill your own father?
{94889}{94966}- See how they brought us in like that?|- Let go of me!
{94971}{95023}You want a good crack in the mouth?
{95028}{95083}Take it easy, Ed. The boy's on edge.
{95089}{95149}- Come on.|- He shouldn't talk to me that way.
{95154}{95203}After all, I am his father.
{95217}{95276}This place appeal to you or something?
{95472}{95528}- What's he going to pull?|- Nothing, Crunch.
{95533}{95613}- Did you see any cops with him?|- He was pulled in like us.
{95623}{95702}Hey, excuse me.|Can you tell me where I can find....
{95727}{95787}I forgot his name.|He works in the juvenile...
{95792}{95822}Can't you see I'm writing?
{95874}{95927}He's going to tell, man. I know.
{95952}{95992}Nobody arrested him.
{96007}{96040}I think I better go home.
{96045}{96084}Hey, wait, man.
{96104}{96147}We'll have some kicks, huh?
{96191}{96260}- Crunch, my father...|- We'll bring him down.
{96265}{96298}What do you say?
{96448}{96488}You're going to clobber him?
{96535}{96592}What, are you out of your mind? Come on.
{96621}{96696}- What I could write about you...|- I remember his name.
{96700}{96744}- What's the charge?|- Assault.
{96748}{96832}- His name is Ray. I'd like to see him.|- He's not here.
{96837}{96873}He's not in Juvenile Hall.
{96878}{96952}I don't know where he is.|He'll be out all night.
{96956}{96982}How old are you?
{96993}{97062}My parents know I'm here.|They know I'm out here.
{97082}{97136}Come back in the morning, will you?
{97141}{97179}Well, can I wait?
{97200}{97247}Have you ever been booked before?
{97259}{97296}Solid.
{97984}{98010}Hello?
{98023}{98054}Who wants her?
{98073}{98097}Who?
{98113}{98148}Jim who?
{98164}{98200}I never heard of you!
{98269}{98326}He didn't have to hang up on him.
{99117}{99151}Hello, Jamie.
{99182}{99210}Jamie?
{99431}{99475}Where'd you get that?
{99608}{99656}How long have you known Plato?
{99770}{99796}About...
{99838}{99895}- Coming up, another request.|...this morning.
{99900}{99976}This time, from the boys|at Anna's Pizza Paradise.
{99980}{100052}A new arrangement|of an oldie in rhythm and blues.
{100058}{100112}Jim, this is dedicated to you...
{100123}{100155}from Buzz.
{100588}{100630}They'll be looking for you.
{100701}{100760}I didn't chicken. You saw where I jumped.
{100764}{100814}What do I have to do, kill myself?
{100840}{100895}It doesn't matter to them.
{100931}{101000}Well, I guess you're still pretty upset, huh?
{101050}{101089}I'm just numb.
{101279}{101314}You know something?
{101372}{101428}I woke up this morning, you know?
{101481}{101528}And the sun was shining...
{101541}{101585}and it was nice...
{101598}{101644}and all that type of stuff.
{101656}{101727}And the first thing, I saw you.
{101805}{101832}And I said:
{101839}{101931}"This will be one terrific day,|so you better live it up...
{101936}{102019}because tomorrow you'll be nothing."
{102044}{102082}See? And I almost was.
{102128}{102163}I'm sorry.
{102200}{102264}I'm sorry that I treated you mean today.
{102296}{102380}Don't believe what I say|when I'm with the rest of the kids.
{102403}{102471}Nobody acts sincere.
{102785}{102820}Why did you do that?
{102824}{102864}I felt like it.
{102951}{102994}Your lips are soft.
{103228}{103256}Where are you going?
{103258}{103292}I don't know.
{103401}{103440}We can't stay here.
{103697}{103738}I know one thing.
{103784}{103868}- I'm not going back in that zoo.|- I'm never going back!
{104046}{104076}Listen....
{104151}{104222}I know a place. Plato told me before.
{104227}{104274}It's an old, deserted mansion...
{104284}{104328}up by the planetarium.
{104364}{104404}Want to go up there with me?
{104620}{104656}You can trust me, Judy.
{104821}{104871}Okay.
{105253}{105303}- What do you want?|- Your friend!
{105308}{105362}Yeah, we got eyes for him. You know it?
{105386}{105461}- Where does he live?|- You guys better beat it!
{105466}{105504}Where does he live?
{105509}{105543}Tell us! Tell us!
{105548}{105602}- Leave me alone!|- Where does he live?
{105635}{105666}Get him! Come on!
{105773}{105803}We want your friend!
{105848}{105900}I got it! I got his address book!
{105905}{105942}Your friend talked!
{105947}{105973}Now you talk!
{105978}{106018}Talk! Talk!
{106040}{106084}What are you doing to him?
{106129}{106183}Let's get out of here!
{106208}{106256}- Did you get the book?|- Got it!
{106820}{106899}Why you want to mix up with|bad boys like that?
{106904}{106972}Why you want to get into trouble|all the time?
{107010}{107080}What you doing with that?|You put that down!
{107084}{107143}Put it down before you hurt yourself!
{107148}{107181}I have to warn him!
{107257}{107302}You stay home, John!
{107372}{107412}Bill Sibley.
{107475}{107516}Sam Stuart.
{107533}{107578}Stark. Jim Stark. Here it is.
{107583}{107660}1753 Angelo. Well, well!
{107836}{107870}Frank, I'm frightened!
{107875}{107932}- What's that pounding?|- I don't know.
{107936}{108007}At first I thought it was Jim....|He's not home yet.
{108012}{108075}He's home, dear. I heard his car.
{108085}{108181}- Well, are you going down there?|- Look, will you please relax?
{108208}{108240}Now, you see?
{108253}{108284}It stopped.
{108332}{108388}I still think you ought to go down there.
{108765}{108799}Who's there?
{108836}{108876}Anybody there?
{108924}{108952}Open it.
{109242}{109281}Who's out there?
{109314}{109384}- Where's your son?|- Where's your baby boy gone to?
{109388}{109452}- We want to talk to him.|- He's not here.
{109562}{109600}Look in his room!
{109784}{109808}Son?
{110049}{110072}Is he there?
{110077}{110125}No, honey, he's not here.
{110355}{110417}- What are you doing?|- Do you know where Jim is?
{110420}{110464}No, I don't know.
{110469}{110512}Do you know where he is?
{110578}{110608}I think....
{110717}{110761}I'm sorry I bothered you.
{110766}{110804}Hey, come back here!
{110808}{110839}Who are you?
{111734}{111770}Careful, Jim.
{112224}{112272}Those noisy neighbors.
{112333}{112357}Come on!
{112456}{112484}Jim, it's me.
{112720}{112764}They're looking for you.
{112782}{112838}Everybody.|Crunch and Goon and everybody!
{112843}{112868}We know.
{112890}{112945}They think you told the police on them.
{112954}{112984}They're going to....
{113088}{113120}Who's in there?
{113124}{113185}Nobody. Just us chickens.
{113254}{113278}Who's in there?
{113283}{113332}Judy. Judy's up there.
{113378}{113432}- Let me in?|- Yeah. All right.
{113436}{113484}But your house is a mess.
{113584}{113616}Watch out.
{113694}{113752}- Where'd he go?|- I don't know.
{114044}{114086}Well, we're safe here.
{114101}{114128}I hope.
{114251}{114298}What do you think of my castle?
{114430}{114466}Well, now, there, then....
{114471}{114527}I think we'll take it for the summer.
{114534}{114572}Right this way.
{114652}{114693}Would you like to rent it?
{114698}{114776}Or are you more in the mood to buy, dear?
{114797}{114843}You decide, darling.
{114854}{114923}- Remember our budget.|- Don't give it a thought.
{114928}{114996}It's only $3,000,000 a month.
{115050}{115080}We can manage that.
{115082}{115164}I'll scrimp and save|and work my fingers to the bone.
{115169}{115219}You see, we're newlyweds.
{115243}{115283}Oh, there's just one thing.
{115288}{115320}What about...?
{115352}{115384}Children?
{115423}{115468}Right this way.
{115488}{115512}Yes.
{115524}{115580}We really don't encourage them.
{115588}{115637}They're so noisy and troublesome.
{115642}{115678}Don't you agree?
{115691}{115735}And so annoying when they cry.
{115740}{115815}I don't know what to do when they cry.|Do you, dear?
{115820}{115860}Drown them like puppies!
{115880}{115952}The nursery's far away|from the rest of the house.
{115956}{115990}Forgot to wind your sundial.
{115992}{116091}If you have children,|you'll find this is a wonderful arrangement.
{116124}{116175}They can carry on and you won't notice.
{116180}{116222}A sunken nursery!
{116232}{116331}In fact, if you lock them in,|you'll never have to see them again.
{116336}{116386}- Much less, talk to them.|- Talk to them?
{116391}{116471}- Nobody talks to children.|- No, they just tell them.
{116544}{116577}What time is it?
{116600}{116645}Hang loose. We've got all night.
{116655}{116744}I wonder if the maid could tell|who we were if she saw us again.
{116748}{116778}Sure she could.
{116794}{116821}I know she could.
{116828}{116873}You still want to go home, Moose?
{116914}{116955}Then shut your mouth...
{116961}{117008}before your guts run out.
{117072}{117112}Quick, fill the pool!
{117244}{117293}Let's see how long we can stay under.
{117340}{117389}You can't talk underwater.
{117936}{117981}I never saw you having so much fun.
{117986}{118061}I came here a lot of times before,|but I never had fun.
{118066}{118098}Why not?
{118113}{118151}Because I was alone.
{118266}{118306}All right!
{118354}{118395}What'd you come back here for?
{118400}{118471}Because I'd run away.|I used to run away a lot...
{118476}{118516}but they always took me back.
{118518}{118542}Who?
{118552}{118586}Mom and Dad.
{118620}{118675}Now that I don't have them I wish...
{118692}{118736}I never had run away.
{118769}{118820}I used to lie in my crib at night...
{118835}{118879}and I'd listen to them fight.
{118894}{118944}Can you remember back that far?
{118983}{119064}I can't even remember|what happened yesterday.
{119103}{119136}I can't.
{119160}{119182}How do you do it?
{119184}{119252}I went to a head shrinker.|He made me remember.
{119257}{119277}Did he?
{119282}{119383}Then my mother said it cost too much,|so she went to Hawaii instead.
{119439}{119482}Well, what's your problem?
{119492}{119528}I don't know...
{119560}{119594}but I'm happy now.
{119610}{119638}Here.
{119656}{119710}I wish we could stay here.
{119787}{119827}Where's your father now?
{119886}{119916}He's dead.
{119945}{120000}He was a hero in the China Sea.
{120081}{120140}You told me he was|a big wheel in New York.
{120208}{120239}I did?
{120270}{120316}What's the difference?
{120335}{120381}He might as well be dead anyway.
{120413}{120456}It's all right.
{120507}{120574}Sure. Sure.
{120834}{120885}I wonder how many rooms in this place?
{120907}{120971}I don't know. A lot, probably.
{120983}{121016}Probably.
{121132}{121176}Do you want to explore?
{122181}{122237}Must have been a nervous day.
{122248}{122300}He must have started out nervous.
{122336}{122387}I've done that, though. Haven't you?
{123274}{123327}That looks like our boy's car, huh?
{123336}{123381}Well, what do you know?
{123776}{123837}Is this what it's like to love somebody?
{123846}{123879}I don't know.
{123928}{123998}What kind of a person|do you think a girl wants?
{124061}{124084}A man.
{124160}{124244}But a man who can be gentle and sweet.
{124266}{124301}Like you are.
{124389}{124464}And someone who doesn't|run away when you want them.
{124490}{124571}Like being Plato's friend|when nobody else liked him.
{124599}{124648}That's being strong.
{124918}{124976}We're not going to be lonely anymore.
{124999}{125043}Ever, ever.
{125064}{125109}Not you or me.
{125144}{125200}I love somebody.
{125221}{125265}All the time I've been...
{125274}{125328}looking for someone to love me.
{125356}{125404}And now I love somebody.
{125443}{125489}And it's so easy.
{125535}{125578}Why is it easy now?
{125649}{125682}I don't know.
{125704}{125748}It is for me too.
{125792}{125834}I love you, Jim.
{125853}{125901}I really mean it.
{125980}{126028}Well, I'm glad.
{126899}{126928}Good morning.
{127296}{127328}Let's take him!
{130504}{130527}That's it.
{130544}{130583}This is unit 17.
{130601}{130692}We just zeroed gray Ford coupe, 1946.
{130697}{130805}Observatory Drive and Crest Place.|Looks like housebreaking.
{130828}{130888}Alert Juvenile and stand by to send help.
{131501}{131540}Save me!
{131708}{131740}Save me!
{132088}{132128}Plato, what's with...?
{132206}{132294}Why did you run out on me?|Why did you leave me alone?
{132373}{132411}What's the matter with you?
{132435}{132480}I thought you were someone else!
{132484}{132524}Who? Plato, it's me! Look at me.
{132532}{132557}What's the matter?
{132559}{132618}Let me go! You're not my father!
{132628}{132668}You're not my father!
{132876}{132906}Halt!
{132917}{132948}Halt!
{133000}{133038}Come here, son.
{133079}{133107}Come here.
{133117}{133175}Walk over quietly. There won't be trouble.
{133469}{133512}Cover the house. I'll get him.
{133932}{133956}Halt!
{134728}{134763}- Did he hit you?|- I'm okay.
{134765}{134810}- Let's go back!|- I'm going after him.
{134815}{134892}- After he tried to shoot you?|- Stay down.
{134897}{134970}He didn't mean it.|We shouldn't have left him.
{134982}{135005}He needs us.
{135007}{135084}He needed you maybe, but so do I.
{135090}{135129}He needs you too.
{135324}{135353}You okay?
{135438}{135468}Come on.
{135633}{135687}You should have heard him tonight.
{135698}{135760}He was talking about you...
{135782}{135844}like you were the hero in the China Sea.
{135946}{135982}You know what he wanted?
{136015}{136068}He tried to make us his family.
{136092}{136141}I guess he just wanted us to be like...
{136170}{136279}his....
{136492}{136519}Halt!
{136600}{136646}Jim, they're killing him!
{137467}{137501}Come out of there!
{137511}{137572}You're making it tough on yourself, kid.
{137577}{137648}Come quietly now.|You didn't kill anybody yet.
{138420}{138451}Need a little help here.
{138453}{138497}We heard firing. He hit anybody?
{138499}{138532}- Are you alone?|- Yeah.
{138538}{138612}We got a kook inside with a gun.|He wounded some kid.
{138621}{138645}How'd he get in?
{138647}{138687}Smashed the front door.
{138693}{138756}- Is there another entrance?|- Down in back.
{138782}{138816}Seal him off.
{138948}{139032}I don't understand. I don't understand.
{139036}{139084}You pray for your children.
{139088}{139184}You read about things like this|happening to other families...
{139244}{139304}but never dream it|could happen to yours.
{139308}{139335}The Observatory?
{139352}{139396}Five housebreaking in area.
{139403}{139455}Right. We'll proceed. Over.
{139480}{139533}There are some other kids in trouble.
{139545}{139581}You'll have to go with me.
{139583}{139644}Sure, sure. That's all right.
{139775}{139819}Lieutenant says seal them off.
{140271}{140304}Hello, Ray.
{140313}{140350}You know anything about this?
{140352}{140382}No more than you do.
{140384}{140428}A kid's in there with a gun.
{140432}{140510}He wounded another kid|and shot at an officer.
{140528}{140596}- You got a speaker?|- Yeah, help yourself.
{140676}{140750}- What's going on?|- Some kid's in trouble. Stay back.
{140755}{140832}I got to know! My boy ran off|and he got a gun too.
{140837}{140880}All right. Lieutenant!
{140898}{140955}I'm addressing the boy in the planetarium.
{140960}{141004}I'm speaking to the boy inside.
{141023}{141091}This is Ray Frameck|from the Juvenile Division.
{141110}{141159}Armed police are outside.
{141170}{141262}Whoever you are,|drop your weapon and come out.
{141302}{141340}Come outside!
{141353}{141460}Clasp your hands over your head|and come outside quietly.
{141523}{141547}Mr. Stark!

{141670}{141706}That's my son.
{141782}{141809}Hold your fire!
{141907}{141937}Are you sure?
{141946}{141986}I think I know my son.
{142087}{142185}Officers, another boy and girl|just ran into the planetarium.
{142190}{142233}We don't know if they're armed.
{142238}{142313}Hold your positions|until further instructions.
{142328}{142409}Another boy and girljust ran|into the planetarium.
{142414}{142462}We don't know if they're armed.
{142468}{142549}Hold your positions|until further instructions.
{142591}{142622}You in there?
{142645}{142700}You're my friend, Plato.
{142727}{142771}That means a lot to me.
{142786}{142854}Hey! I'm going to open the door now.
{143122}{143169}You can shoot me if you want to.
{143360}{143425}Boy, I'm blind as a bat.
{143431}{143468}You got a match?
{143546}{143587}I'll break my neck in here.
{143589}{143624}Where are you?
{143656}{143694}I've got a gun.
{143768}{143801}Yeah, I know.
{143890}{143952}- Light a match, will you?|- No.
{144031}{144062}How are you?
{144092}{144130}I'm fine.
{144135}{144172}That's fine.
{144392}{144484}Do you think the end of the world|will come at nighttime?
{144583}{144616}At dawn.

{145706}{145742}That's all there is to it.
{146012}{146080}I'm not going to hurt you|or anything like that.
{146261}{146312}Why did you run out on me?
{146364}{146406}We didn't run out on you.
{146427}{146477}We were coming right back, I told you.

{147428}{147470}It's warm. Here.
{147492}{147539}My jacket. It's warm.
{147587}{147623}Can I keep it?
{147628}{147668}Well, what do you think?
{147793}{147856}Hey, now can I have the gun, Plato?

{147948}{148002}- My gun?|- Yeah. In your pocket.
{148007}{148039}Give it to me.
{148280}{148320}No, I need it.
{148420}{148468}Don't you trust me, Plato?
{148523}{148564}Just give it to me for a second.
{148796}{148851}Been carrying this around all day?

{149131}{149176}lot of people out front.

{149736}{149779}They want you to be safe.
{149832}{149875}And.... Oh, here.
{149886}{149935}They said I could come in here...
{149940}{149987}and I could bring you out, and...
{149992}{150018}Why?
{150059}{150087}Why?
{150112}{150150}Because they like you.
{150252}{150280}Come on.
{150716}{150752}It's too bright.
{150882}{150915}I'll fix it.

{151337}{151366}Yes, I'm here.
{151405}{151456}Hey, turn out those lights!
{151468}{151512}If you do, we'll come out!

{152152}{152203}- Just a guy.|- I shot at one of them.
{152208}{152259}It's all right. You didn't hurt him.
{152264}{152310}Those are not my friends!
{152330}{152372}Make them go away.
{152432}{152535}You want me to make them go away?|You want me to fix it? Okay.
{152668}{152730}Ray, can you make those guys get back?

{153080}{153143}Plato doesn't.... Turn out the lights!
