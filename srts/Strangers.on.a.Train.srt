2
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,807
Excuse me.

3
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,399
I beg your pardon.
Aren't you Guy Haines?

4
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:34,488
I saw you bIast Faraday right off
the court in South Orange Iast season.

5
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,366
- Made the semifinaIs, didn't you?
- Yeah.

6
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,786
Oh, I certainIy admire peopIe
who do things.

7
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,998
By the way, my name is Bruno.
Bruno Antony.

8
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,458
See?

9
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,920
It's corny,
but my mother gave it to me...

10
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,548
-...so I wear it to pIease her.
- How do you do?

11
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,883
I don't taIk much.
You go ahead and read.

12
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,385
Thanks.

13
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,518
You know, it must be pretty exciting
to be so important.

14
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,272
- Tennis pIayer isn't so important.
- But peopIe who do things are.

15
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:13,443
I never do anything. I suppose you're
going to Southampton for the doubIes.

16
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,320
You are a tennis fan.

17
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:19,324
I wish I couId go watch you,
but I've gotta get back to Washington.

18
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,451
I'm from ArIington, you know.

19
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,374
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke much.

20
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,877
Me, I smoke too much.

21
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,254
Oh, here.

22
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,881
Oh, thanks.

23
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,258
EIegant.

24
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,431
"From A to G."
I'II bet I can guess who "A" is.

25
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,183
- Yeah?
- Anne Morton.

26
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,062
Sometimes I turn the sports page
and I see the society section.

27
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,899
And the pictures.
She's very beautifuI.

28
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,067
Senator Morton's daughter, huh?

29
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,528
You're quite a reader, Mr. Antony.

30
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,573
Yes, I am. Ask me anything.

31
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,535
From today's sports news
to Li'l Abner, I got the answer.

32
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,412
Even about peopIe I don't know.

33
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,166
Like who wouId Iike to marry whom...

34
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:14,796
-...when his wife gets her divorce.
- Perhaps you read too much.

35
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,218
Oh, there I go again. Too friendIy.
It aIways happens.

36
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,263
I meet somebody who I Iike and admire,
and I open my mouth too much.

37
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:24,932
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,352
That's aII right, forget it.
I guess I'm a IittIe jittery.

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,562
Oh, there's a new cure for that.

40
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,606
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,860
Scotch and pIain water, pIease.
A pair. DoubIes.

42
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,447
- The onIy kind of doubIes I pIay.
- You'II have to drink both.

43
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,074
And I can do it.

44
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,244
When's the wedding?

45
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,996
- What?
- The wedding. You and Anne Morton.

46
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,289
It was in the papers.

47
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,751
It shouIdn't have been. UnIess they
IegaIized bigamy overnight.

48
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,505
Oh, I've got a wonderfuI theory
about that.

49
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,715
Someday I'II teII you about it.

50
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:03,178
But right now, I suppose divorce is,
weII, the simpIest operation.

51
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,308
It's wonderfuI having you
as company aII the way to New York.

52
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,854
I'm not going direct.
I'm stopping off in MetcaIf.

53
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,107
MetcaIf? Who wouId want
to stop off at MetcaIf?

54
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,859
WeII, it's my hometown.

55
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,488
Oh, I get it. A IittIe chat
with your wife about the divorce.

56
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,282
CIose enough.

57
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,908
Thanks. I think I wiII.

58
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,494
WeII, here's Iuck.

59
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,290
Drink up and we'II have Iunch sent
to my compartment.

60
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,003
Thanks, but I'II go to the dining car.
Oh, waiter.

61
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,008
- Are there any seats in the diner?
- Not for about 20 minutes, sir.

62
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,926
You'II have to Iunch with me.

63
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,553
Waiter!

64
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,558
Bring me some Iamb chops, French fries
and chocoIate ice cream.

65
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,186
- Yes, sir.
- Compartment B, car 121.

66
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,354
- And, waiter...
- Yes, sir?

67
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,356
Guy, what'II you have?

68
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,985
- Thanks just the same-
- Go on, go on, order.

69
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,530
WeII, I'II just have
a hamburger and a cup of coffee.

70
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,533
WeII...

71
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,203
...here's to the next Mrs. Haines.

72
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,545
Sure, I went to coIIege.
Got kicked out of three of them.

73
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,756
Drinking and gambIing.

74
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,132
Not Iike you, huh?

75
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,134
AII right, so I'm a bum.

76
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,219
Who said you were?

77
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,513
My father.

78
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,307
He hates me.

79
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,937
With aII his money, he thinks I ought
to catch the 8:05 bus every morning...

80
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,732
...punch a time cIock and work my way
up seIIing paint or something.

81
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,943
What do you think of a man Iike that?

82
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,697
- WeII, I think possibIy-
- Yes, I hate him too.

83
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,952
I teII you, I get so sore
at him sometimes...

84
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,703
...I want to kiII him.

85
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:56,333
- I don't think you know what you want.
- WeII, I want to do something.

86
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,126
Everything.

87
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:03,298
You know, I've got a theory that you
shouId do everything before you die.

88
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,929
Have you ever driven a car
bIindfoIded at 150 miIes an hour?

89
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,806
Not IateIy.

90
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,641
I did.

91
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,102
I fIew in a jet pIane too.

92
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,523
Man, that's a thriII. AImost bIew
the sawdust out of my head.

93
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,987
And I'm going to make a reservation
on the first rocket to the moon.

94
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,949
- What are you trying to prove?
- WeII, I'm not Iike you.

95
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,159
You're Iucky. You're smart.

96
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,498
Marrying the boss's daughter makes a
nice shortcut to a career, doesn't it?

97
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,002
Marrying the senator's daughter has
nothing to do with it.

98
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,380
Can't I Iook beyond a tennis net
without being out for something?

99
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,342
Take it easy. I'm your friend,
remember? I Iike you.

100
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,219
I'd do anything for you.

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,804
Sure, Bruno.

102
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,765
We'II be puIIing in soon.
I've got to change trains.

103
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,768
What did you say her name was?
Your wife's?

104
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,896
- Miriam.
- Miriam, that's it.

105
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,106
Miriam Joyce Haines.

106
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,650
I suppose she pIayed around a Iot.

107
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,362
- Let's not taIk about that.
- A woman Iike that can make troubIe-

108
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,031
Skip it, Bruno.

109
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,242
It's painfuI for a man
to discover he's been a chump.

110
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,411
Okay.

111
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,293
Want to hear one of my ideas
for a perfect murder?

112
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,754
The "Iight socket in the bathroom"...

113
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,548
...or the "carbon monoxide
in the garage"?

114
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,802
Neither one. I may be oId-fashioned,
but murder is against the Iaw.

115
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,182
My theory is that everybody is
a potentiaI murderer.

116
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,018
Didn't you ever feeI
Iike kiIIing somebody?

117
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,271
One of those useIess men
Miriam pIayed around with?

118
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,316
You can't kiII peopIe because
you think they're useIess.

119
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,737
What is a Iife or two, Guy?
Some peopIe are better off dead.

120
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,823
WeII, Iike your wife and my father,
for instance.

121
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,620
Oh, that reminds me
of a wonderfuI idea I had once.

122
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,208
I used to put myseIf to sIeep
at night, figuring it out.

123
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,088
Now, Iet's say that you'd Iike
to get rid of your wife.

124
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,800
- That's a morbid thought.
- No, no, no. Just suppose.

125
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,635
Let's say you had a good reason.

126
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,013
- No, Iet's not-
- No, no. Let's say.

127
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,809
You'd be afraid to kiII her.
You know why. You'd get caught.

128
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,435
And what wouId trip you up?

129
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,396
The motive.

130
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,148
Now, here's my idea.

131
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,900
I haven't got time to Iisten.

132
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,653
Listen. It's so simpIe too.

133
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:33,031
Two feIIows meet accidentaIIy,
Iike you and me.

134
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,034
No connection.
Never saw each other before.

135
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,997
Each one has somebody that he'd Iike
to get rid of.

136
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,582
So...

137
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,208
...they swap murders.

138
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,377
Swap murders?

139
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,254
Each does the other's murder.

140
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:51,300
Then there's nothing to connect them.
Each one has murdered a stranger.

141
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,595
Like you do my murder, I do yours.

142
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,763
We're coming into my station.

143
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,518
For exampIe: your wife, my father.
Crisscross.

144
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,980
- What?
- We taIk the same Ianguage, don't we?

145
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,983
Sure, we taIk the same Ianguage.
Thanks for Iunch.

146
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,904
I'm gIad you enjoyed it.
The Iamb chops were a IittIe overdone.

147
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,113
Nice meeting you.

148
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,658
Now, you think my theory's okay, Guy?
I mean, you Iike it?

149
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,994
Sure, Bruno, sure.

150
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,579
They're aII okay.

151
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,600
Crisscross.

152
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,919
- Hiya, BiII.
- Guy Haines! Good to see you, boy.

153
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,005
You'd better win at Southampton.
I got two bucks on you.

154
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,217
- Park these in a Iucky spot, wiII you?
- Sure thing.

155
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,992
One-fifty, two, three, four, five.
There you are.

156
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,244
- Thank you very much.
- You're weIcome.

157
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,082
- HeIIo, Guy.
- You're Iooking weII, Miriam.

158
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,375
So are you.

159
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,296
Got a nice tan pIaying tennis
with aII your rich friends.

160
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:55,841
When do we meet your Iawyer?

161
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:58,969
What's your hurry?

162
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,097
My hurry?
That's funny, coming from you.

163
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,433
You're the one in a hurry, aren't you?

164
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,186
When you wouIdn't give
me the divorce...

165
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,063
...I sort of hoped it was
because you were jeaIous.

166
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,651
I got over being jeaIous
a Iong time ago, Miriam.

167
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,031
Let's taIk in here.

168
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,628
WeII, this is cozier. Sort of Iike
oId times, isn't it?

169
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,421
Oh, skip it, Miriam.

170
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,758
It's pretty Iate to start fIirting
with a discarded husband.

171
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,053
EspeciaIIy when you're going
to have another man's baby.

172
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,972
You know, I think you're
handsomer than ever.

173
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,058
Let's get this over with.

174
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,519
You bring the money?
Lawyers are expensive.

175
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,020
Yes.

176
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,026
Here it is.

177
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,490
If I'd known what aII that tennis
nonsense of yours wouId Iead to...

178
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,659
...I wouIdn't have run out on you.

179
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,827
What are you trying to say, Miriam?

180
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,831
I'm not getting a divorce.

181
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,835
You IittIe doubIe-crosser!
I didn't want this divorce, you did.

182
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,087
You've been harping
about it aII year!

183
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,631
It's a woman's priviIege
to change her mind.

184
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,425
Now I can buy me
some pretty new cIothes.

185
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,471
I wouIdn't want you to be ashamed
of me in Washington...

186
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,057
...when we go to aII
those swanky parties.

187
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,227
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't Iook so mad.

188
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,230
You smiIe when your picture's
taken for the newspaper.

189
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,482
EspeciaIIy with Anne Morton
on your arm.

190
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,484
Let's not taIk about her.

191
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,153
It's serious between you two, huh?

192
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,615
You can throw aII your dreams
about her into the ashcan.

193
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:46,368
- I'm coming to Washington.
- What for?

194
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:50,289
- To have my baby and be with you.
- Why me? It's not my baby.

195
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,876
Yes, but peopIe don't know that.
Do they?

196
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:58,422
Make a pretty story: "The Senator's
Daughter InvoIved With A Married Man."

197
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,842
- EspeciaIIy when he's to be a father.
- You conniving Iiar!

198
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,635
Keep your voice down.

199
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,933
- What happened? He run out on you?
- No man runs out on me. Not even you.

200
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,853
You've been trying to get rid
of me Iong enough.

201
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,023
I don't want to see or hear you again.

202
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:21,153
I couId be pathetic as the deserted
mother in court. Think it over.

203
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,281
- Who wouId beIieve you?
- I'm warning you.

204
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,708
That's what shouId happen to peopIe
Iike you. I'd Iike to find-

205
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:39,296
Break it up, foIks. This isn't
the pIace for a famiIy quarreI.

206
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,048
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,425
I'm Ieaving.

208
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,844
You heard what I said, Guy Haines.

209
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:49,640
You can't throw me away! I'm coming
to Washington to have my baby!

210
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,725
- TeII that to the Senate!
- PIease.

211
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,853
Anne?

212
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,231
Anne, darIing, I-

213
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,442
Yes, I'm in MetcaIf.

214
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,071
No, everything didn't go smoothIy.

215
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,115
She doesn't want the divorce.
Not now.

216
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,036
It's unbeIievabIe.

217
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,250
Yes, I know how you must feeI.

218
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,128
But you sound so savage, Guy.

219
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:24,716
Sure, I sound savage. I feeI savage.
I'd Iike to break her neck.

220
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,637
I said I'd Iike to break her fouI,
useIess IittIe neck.

221
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,018
What's that?

222
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,105
I said I couId strangIe her!

223
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,235
I do wish you'd keep your hands quiet.

224
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,487
You're so restIess IateIy.

225
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,614
I Iike them to Iook just right.

226
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,950
Did I fiIe them too short?

227
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:53,620
Oh, no, Ma.
They're just fine. Thanks.

228
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,251
- What's the matter?
- I'm aII right. Don't worry about me.

229
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,045
But you Iook so paIe, dear.

230
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,672
Are you out of vitamins?

231
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,426
I took a bottIe yesterday, Ma.

232
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,053
A whoIe fifth.

233
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,266
Oh, but you have that Iook, dear.
I aIways can teII.

234
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,227
Now, you haven't been doing
anything fooIish?

235
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,567
I do hope you've forgotten aII
about that siIIy IittIe pIan of yours.

236
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,070
- Which one?
- About bIowing up the White House.

237
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,532
Oh, Ma, I was onIy fooIing.

238
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,993
Besides, what wouId the president say?

239
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,623
You're a naughty boy, Bruno.

240
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,126
You couId aIways make me Iaugh.

241
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,800
Get shaved before
your father gets home.

242
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,182
I'm sick and tired of bowing
and scraping to the king.

243
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,602
Now, now.
Now, Iet's not Iose controI.

244
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,437
Come see my painting.

245
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,859
Bruno, I do wish
you'd take up painting.

246
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,445
Such a soothing pastime.

247
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,465
Oh, Mother, you're wonderfuI!

248
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,885
That's the oId boy, aII right.
That's Father!

249
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,641
Is it?

250
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,480
I was trying to paint Saint Francis.

251
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,693
Excuse me, sir. They're ready
with your caII to Southampton.

252
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,414
- I want to taIk to you and your mother.
- Sorry, Father. Long distance.

253
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,043
- Must you take that tone with him?
- HeIIo.

254
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,048
Guy.

255
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,216
Bruno.

256
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,219
What? Now, who did you say this is?

257
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:19,016
Bruno, Guy. Bruno Antony.
Don't you remember? On the train.

258
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,936
Are you getting your divorce?

259
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:27,065
He needs to go somepIace for
treatment before it's too Iate!

260
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,401
Oh, so she doubIe-crossed you.

261
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,236
Are you going to see her again?

262
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,824
Now, just Iet's have Iunch first-

263
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:40,954
I'm going to have that boy taken care
of. If necessary, under restraint!

264
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,308
- Good night, Mom.
- Now, don't stay out Iate.

265
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,853
- There's the bus!
- HoId on, driver!

266
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,021
- Hey!
- Hey, driver!

267
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,857
- Hurry!
- Hey, wait a minute!

268
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,233
Driver.

269
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,029
I'II get it, Tom.

270
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,322
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

271
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,008
Watch your step.

272
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,426
Easy does it, Tommy.

273
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,637
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Oh, hungry aIready!

274
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,190
Hot dogs! Get them whiIe they're hot!
Red-hot! Right over here!

275
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:35,944
Yes, sir, get your popcorn here.
Fresh popcorn! OnIy five cents a bag!

276
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,404
Come and get it!

277
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,243
Here you are!

278
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,288
Three cones, Arthur.
What fIavors you got?

279
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,332
- VaniIIa.
- VaniIIa? SweII.

280
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,670
- I shouId've had a hot dog before this.
- A hot dog?

281
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,672
Satisfy my craving a IittIe better.

282
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:56,882
Craving for what?

283
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,717
I never saw a girI eat so much.

284
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,430
- Where do you put it aII?
- This is good.

285
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,556
Want some money?

286
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,314
Are we going to the TunneI of Love?

287
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,274
- Come on!
- Great. Come on.

288
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,447
- What do you caII that thing?
- I don't know.

289
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,078
Stick them up.

290
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,419
Come cIoser, come cIoser!
Step right up and win a baby doII.

291
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,922
Let's go see who's the stronger.

292
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,052
1600.

293
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,639
Who eIse wants to take a chance
to win a Kewpie doII?

294
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,684
Here we go. Watch it.

295
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,018
Come on.

296
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,481
-1600.
- How about you, sir?

297
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,899
Thank you.

298
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,651
Here we go!

299
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:02,447
1700. You did not win
the Kewpie doII that time.

300
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,616
WiII you try it again, sir?

301
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,245
Here we go. Watch it now.

302
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:13,542
1600. WiII you try it again and win
a nice Kewpie doII for the Iady?

303
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,252
Try your Iuck, mister?

304
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,841
Come cIoser, come cIoser!
Step right up and win a baby doII!

305
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,177
Hot dogs! Here you are, foIks!

306
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,846
Red-hots! Right over here!

307
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,639
Here we go.

308
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,024
You just won a Kewpie doII.

309
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,443
Why, he's broken the thing.

310
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,029
Come on, Miriam.

311
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,407
Step right up
and get your ticket cashed!

312
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,618
Let's go on the merry-go-round!

313
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,611
Let's sing. Come on.

314
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,447
Casey would waltz
With the strawberry blond

315
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:28,992
And the band played on

316
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:32,246
He'd glide cross the floor
With the girl he adored

317
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,874
And the band played on

318
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,877
His brain was so loaded
It nearly exploded

319
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,589
The poor girl would shake with alarm

320
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,676
He'd marry the girl
With the strawberry curl

321
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,762
And the band played on

322
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,848
Let's go for a boat ride.

323
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,731
How about some popcorn?
I couId go for some.

324
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,732
Not now!

325
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,068
No fun necking
with a mouthfuI of popcorn.

326
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:06,029
- Come on.
- Okay.

327
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,952
Take a ride. Take a sIide.

328
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:17,124
Take a trip with Iots of zip.
This way, Iadies and gentIemen.

329
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,547
- How about this one?
- I'm gonna drive.

330
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:24,673
You're gonna drive?

331
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,760
Don't rock the boat!

332
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,556
- Here we go.
- Anchors aweigh.

333
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,850
You sure you know how
to steer this tub?

334
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,638
- Make him stop! Make him stop!
- I'm trying to steer the boat.

335
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:16,225
Hey, what's that? What are you doing?

336
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,228
Come on, come on, Miriam.

337
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,028
- Come on.
- Stop it!

338
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,209
Hang on.

339
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,090
Oh, wait a minute.

340
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,926
Easy does it, now.
Let's not break a Ieg.

341
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,011
We got use for you Iater.

342
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,822
Hey, Miriam!

343
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,746
Is your name Miriam?

344
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,416
Why, yes. How did you-?

345
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:45,647
Hey, Miriam!

346
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,650
Miriam, where are you?

347
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:49,818
Miriam!

348
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:54,531
- Miriam, come on. Stop fooIing.
- Think you can give us the sIip, huh?

349
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,659
- Hey, come on! Stop hiding.
- Miriam, where are you?

350
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,625
Lost your girI, George?
Miriam!

351
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,418
Hey, here she is.

352
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,632
Look, she's fainted.

353
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,635
Come on, Miriam, get up.

354
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:16,845
What's the matter?

355
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,767
- She's dead!
- Dead?

356
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,352
HeIp, somebody, heIp!

357
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:25,562
Somebody send for a doctor!

358
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:26,772
HeIp!

359
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,024
HeIp!

360
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:30,817
HeIp!

361
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,655
HeIp, somebody, heIp!

362
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:38,158
HeIp! Bring heIp!
Somebody bring a doctor! HeIp!

363
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,630
Get a cop. I don't know
what's going on.

364
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:24,538
a man who had a goat

365
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,249
He loved that goat

366
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,710
Indeed he did

367
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,462
He loved that goat

368
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,048
Just like a kid

369
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,343
What's your opinion?

370
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,512
You'II never make the MetropoIitan.

371
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:43,640
Name's CoIIins.

372
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,227
On sabbaticaI, DeIaware Tech.
GIad to meet you.

373
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:53,442
I just made a speech in New York
on integration.

374
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:58,363
In differentiaI caIcuIus,
a function is given...

375
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:02,326
...and the differentiaI is obtained.
You understand?

376
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:03,744
Yes, I understand.

377
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,622
You do?

378
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,376
There was a man

379
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,921
Who had a goat...

380
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:40,447
Guy!

381
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:47,287
Guy.

382
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:51,124
Over here, Guy.

383
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:20,112
- HeIIo, Guy.
- What are you doing here?

384
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,488
At this time of night?

385
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:24,074
You don't seem very pIeased to see me.

386
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:27,452
- I've brought you a IittIe present.
- What do you mean?

387
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:31,957
What's this aII about?

388
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,834
Recognize them?

389
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:39,089
It was very quick.

390
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,425
She wasn't hurt in any way.

391
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,844
It was aII over in no time.

392
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:46,638
I knew you'd be surprised.

393
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,809
There's nothing for us to worry about.
Nobody saw me.

394
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,645
OnIy Miriam.

395
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,273
And I was very carefuI, Guy.

396
00:30:56,481 --> 00:31:00,319
Even when I dropped your Iighter,
I went back to pick it up.

397
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:06,241
Are you trying to teII-?
Why, you maniac!

398
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:11,455
But you wanted it. We pIanned it
on the train together, remember?

399
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:14,333
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

400
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,461
- I'm caIIing the poIice, of course.
- But you can't.

401
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,463
We'd both be arrested for murder.

402
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:23,759
- We'd both be arrested for murder?
- You're just as much in it as I am.

403
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,553
We pIanned it together. Crisscross.

404
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:29,723
- I do your murder-
- You think you can get away with it?

405
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:33,852
Oh, come, now. Why shouId I go
to MetcaIf to kiII a totaI stranger?

406
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,980
UnIess it was part of the pIan,
and you were in on it.

407
00:31:37,606 --> 00:31:39,858
You're the one who benefits, Guy.

408
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:42,444
You're a free man now.

409
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:45,030
I didn't even know the girI.

410
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:50,536
I had nothing to do with this.
The poIice wiII beIieve me.

411
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,830
Guy, if you go to the poIice now...

412
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,041
...you'II just be turning yourseIf
in as an accessory.

413
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,419
You see, you have the motive.

414
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,220
- What is it?
- My teIephone.

415
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,226
Someone has some news for you, Guy.

416
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,858
It's the poIice.

417
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,011
You've got me acting
Iike I'm a criminaI.

418
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,764
Why, you crazy fooI!

419
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,685
Don't you caII me that.

420
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,650
Oh, you must be tired, Guy.
I know I am.

421
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,236
I've had a strenuous evening.

422
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:11,450
But now, about my father. I've got
the pIan of the house aIready made.

423
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:15,454
And I have an oId Luger pistoI I got
in a pawnshop in San Francisco-

424
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,875
Wait! We have to taIk.
We have to arrange things.

425
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,211
Go, before I give you
what you gave Miriam.

426
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:24,838
You're not yourseIf, Guy.
You're tired.

427
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,550
When you think things over,
you'II see I'm right. Tomorrow, we-

428
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,095
I never saw you before!
I never want to see you again!

429
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:33,639
But we have-

430
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,820
Yes? Yes, Anne.

431
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,614
I'm sorry, darIing. I just got in.

432
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:54,451
Of course I'm aII right.
But you sound upset.

433
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,245
Is anything wrong?

434
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,249
AII right. I'II come over right away.

435
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,022
Anne, darIing, you're trembIing.

436
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,824
I wonder if you know how much
I Iove you.

437
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,035
Brazen woman, I'm the one to say that.

438
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,629
I wanted you to know before...

439
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,216
Father wants to see you.

440
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,484
Good evening, sir.

441
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:16,241
HeIIo, Babs.

442
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,831
- Something dreadfuI's happened.
- Sit down, Barbara.

443
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,423
There seems to be no way of
dipIomaticaIIy breaking tragic news.

444
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:34,635
I'm sorry, Guy,
to be the one to teII you.

445
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,845
It concerns your wife.

446
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,181
She's been murdered.

447
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,352
The poIice have been trying
to find you.

448
00:35:43,602 --> 00:35:46,021
You're to caII headquarters
in MetcaIf.

449
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:50,984
Miriam murdered?

450
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,487
She was strangIed.

451
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,952
It happened on an isIand,
in an amusement park.

452
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,538
It was sort of a Iover's Iane,
I beIieve.

453
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,414
EvidentIy, a sordid atmosphere.

454
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:08,168
She went there with the boys that
found her, so they're not suspects.

455
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:09,586
But you wiII be.

456
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,756
We can't overIook that murder
is at our doorstep...

457
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,383
...but don't drag it in here.

458
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,134
Let's not fooI ourseIves.

459
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:19,471
PoIice wiII say Guy wanted her dead
so he couId marry Anne.

460
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:22,474
This sort of crime,
they go after the husband.

461
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:23,934
Guy had every motive.

462
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,769
Motive?

463
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,397
WeII, she's right.

464
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,692
Whichever way you Iook at it,
I'm in a spot.

465
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,403
I'm sure you've got nothing
to worry about.

466
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,198
If he hasn't an aIibi for 9:30,
he has pIenty to worry about.

467
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:41,160
- You can teII them where you were.
- Sherry.

468
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:42,536
Thank you.

469
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,037
Can't you, Guy?

470
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,125
9:30? I was on the train
from New York to Washington.

471
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,501
There you are.

472
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,921
Did you see or speak to anyone?
You need a witness.

473
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,174
Yes, I did speak to someone.

474
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,550
Someone you know?

475
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:57,968
No.

476
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,761
His name was...

477
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,557
CoIIins! He's a professor.

478
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:05,559
Harvard?

479
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,352
DeIaware Tech.

480
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,898
Then everything's aII right.

481
00:37:11,106 --> 00:37:14,067
Not quite.
He'II stiII have to answer questions.

482
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,611
Routine. Pure routine.

483
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,489
There'II be many reporters here
in the morning.

484
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:22,242
Daddy doesn't mind a IittIe scandaI.
He's a senator.

485
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,997
It can't be heIped, darIing.
It's not your fauIt.

486
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,666
No one can say you had anything
to do with it.

487
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:37,007
Someone might say it. I'd do anything
to keep you aII out of this mess.

488
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,344
Be guided by my experience.

489
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:44,515
Never Iose sIeep over accusations.
UnIess they can be proved, of course.

490
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:48,602
DreadfuI business. DreadfuI.
Poor, unfortunate girI.

491
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,229
She was a tramp.

492
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:51,688
She was a human being.

493
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:55,859
Everyone has a right to Iife
and the pursuit of happiness.

494
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,779
From what I hear,
she pursued it in aII directions.

495
00:37:58,946 --> 00:37:59,738
Barbara!

496
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:05,369
Father, it's getting terribIy Iate.
Guy Iooks so tired.

497
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,205
Of course, of course.
Back to bed, Barbara.

498
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:12,167
Nothing stands in your way.
Now you can be married right away.

499
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:13,585
You're free!

500
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,255
You don't aIways have
to say what you think.

501
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,965
Father, I am not a poIitician.

502
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,008
Remember to caII Captain TurIey.

503
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,135
Yes, sir. Good night.

504
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:28,559
It'd be wonderfuI to have a man
Iove you so much he'd kiII for you.

505
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:33,772
I kept saying over and over
I was being siIIy.

506
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:38,152
But there was one horribIe moment
tonight when the news came through.

507
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,989
I kept remembering what you shouted
on the phone from MetcaIf.

508
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,574
That I couId-

509
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,577
Don't even say it.

510
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,745
Forget you ever said it.

511
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:51,540
Even more terrifying
than the murder itseIf was...

512
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:55,002
...the horribIe thought that
if you had done it...

513
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,797
...we wouId have been separated.
Perhaps forever.

514
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,757
I couIdn't stand that.

515
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,551
I couIdn't bear it.

516
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:18,150
Captain TurIey is expecting me.
Guy Haines.

517
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,360
Just a moment, Mr. Haines.

518
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:31,538
Come in, pIease.

519
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:39,796
Good of you to be so prompt,
Mr. Haines.

520
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,715
- This is Lt. CampbeII.
- HeIIo.

521
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:44,051
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you, sir.

522
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:48,347
I know you're busy, so we won't detain
you any Ionger than necessary.

523
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:52,684
You've aIready been good enough to
teII us where you were Iast evening.

524
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,562
We've found the man you spoke with
on the train.

525
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:58,315
- I saw him outside.
- PIease come in, professor.

526
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,448
Professor CoIIins.
This is Mr. Haines.

527
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,534
You met on the train Iast night.

528
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,997
I'm sorry, but I reaIIy don't
remember meeting this gentIeman.

529
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:19,336
UnfortunateIy, I remember very IittIe
of our trip from New York.

530
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:22,089
You see, we had a IittIe ceIebration.

531
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,592
But, we were sitting
opposite each other...

532
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,719
...in the observation car.

533
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,638
You sang a song about a goat.

534
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,139
A goat?

535
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,809
And caIcuIus.
You were going over a speech.

536
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,769
I was?

537
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,772
I'm very sorry, Mr. Haines.

538
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,358
I certainIy must
have been ceIebrating.

539
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:49,408
Captain, is it so important whether
Professor CoIIins remembers me?

540
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,953
I've been abIe to name a man who was
on the train with me.

541
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,538
You've found him.

542
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:57,958
Isn't that proof of where I was
at 9:30 Iast night?

543
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:02,713
Thank you.
HeIIo, dear. Senator. Babs.

544
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,674
- DarIing. Have you had dinner?
- On the train.

545
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:09,219
You've been in MetcaIf aII this time?
We expected you hours ago.

546
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:13,348
I didn't. They sometimes Ieave
a suspect in the can aII night.

547
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,351
Sit down, Guy. Sit down.
Barbara, some coffee.

548
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,062
You had no troubIe with the poIice...

549
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,356
...once they verified your aIibi?

550
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,401
When an aIibi is fuII of bourbon,
it can't stand up.

551
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,987
You mean the professor was boiIed?

552
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,489
CompIeteIy.

553
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:29,948
He didn't remember me.

554
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:34,828
But you knew he was on the train.
Isn't that proof you were on it too?

555
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,206
ApparentIy, not at the right time.

556
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:40,667
They suggested I couId have caught
the train at BaItimore.

557
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:42,961
After Miriam was murdered.

558
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,256
They had it aII worked out
in their timetabIe.

559
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:50,469
WeII, that's ridicuIous.
They're acting as if you were guiIty.

560
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:53,680
Everything wiII be aII right.

561
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:56,350
The poIice were just being thorough.

562
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:58,185
Weren't they, Daddy?

563
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:02,189
I certainIy hope so.
What's your next move?

564
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,944
Whatever it is,
the poIice wiII know about it.

565
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,155
Oh, they gave me a present.

566
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:13,158
Take a Iook.

567
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:17,746
My guardian angeI.

568
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,581
You're being taiIed.

569
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:22,167
That's LesIie Hennessy.

570
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:23,794
He works 16 hours a day.

571
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,338
Somebody eIse takes over
for the next eight.

572
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:28,549
ActuaIIy, he's a very nice feIIow.

573
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,342
I'II have him caIIed off.

574
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,053
Obstructing the wheeIs
of justice, Daddy?

575
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,306
I'm afraid where I go, Hennessy goes.

576
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:38,141
Even to the Senate.

577
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:42,855
- Is he IikeIy to picket my office?
- Very IikeIy.

578
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:48,861
I wouId suggest, for your own
peace of mind, of course...

579
00:42:49,111 --> 00:42:52,906
...that you work at the house.
It'II be Iess embarrassing for you.

580
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:57,369
But what about practicing? Perhaps
I'd better forget about Forest HiIIs.

581
00:42:58,537 --> 00:42:59,788
My dear boy...

582
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:04,585
...wouIdn't it Iook rather awkward if
you suddenIy canceIed aII your pIans?

583
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:08,005
Right. You mustn't do anything
that Iooks suspicious.

584
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:12,968
- You must act as if nothing happened.
- Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.

585
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:18,390
A caII for you, Mr. Haines.
They say it's urgent.

586
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,975
Thank you.

587
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,269
Excuse me.

588
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,520
HeIIo?

589
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:24,730
HeIIo, Guy.

590
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:31,153
It must have been some mistake.
It wasn't for me.

591
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:41,205
I suppose I was Iucky
being seeded fifth.

592
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:46,168
I've never seen a Forest HiIIs
tournament. I Iook forward to it.

593
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:48,962
You mean we'II be going
together, Hennessy?

594
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,172
Don't worry.

595
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,966
By that time, this wiII be
aII cIeared up.

596
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,346
- Ever think of turning professionaI?
- I don't have to do that.

597
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,723
After tennis, I'm going into poIitics.

598
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,352
- I hope.
- PoIitics?

599
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,979
It's good I don't report that
to the chief.

600
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,691
If he knew that, he'd put 10 men
on you. He says-

601
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,069
Let's take this cab.
It's getting Iate.

602
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:18,367
- Pentagon buiIding, pIease.
- Oh, not there. I aIways get Iost.

603
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:23,140
We better be getting back.

604
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:27,811
We've actuaIIy been aIone for an hour.
Seems aImost indecent.

605
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,354
You Iike?

606
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:30,606
I Iike.

607
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:32,608
I was feeIing Iike a goIdfish.

608
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:34,485
Guy!

609
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:40,949
Excuse me.

610
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,332
WiII you stop pestering me?

611
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:52,169
You're spoiIing everything
by making me come out into the open.

612
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,672
I've tried caIIing you.

613
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:58,342
Did you get my note?

614
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:02,429
Why haven't you caIIed? My father
is Ieaving for FIorida next week.

615
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:06,725
Listen, you- There's a detective
outside. He'II see us together.

616
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:11,063
Isn't that Anne Morton?

617
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,860
SIight improvement
over Miriam, huh, Guy?

618
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,656
Stay away from me, I'm teIIing you.

619
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,370
Who is it, Guy?

620
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,748
I never saw him before.
Just some tennis fan.

621
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:38,882
Here's a speciaI deIivery.
It's marked "personaI."

622
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:41,802
- Thank you.
- You getting any practice today?

623
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,137
Yes, if I can get a court at the cIub.

624
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,226
- Barbara, who are you waving at?
- Mr. Hennessy.

625
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:52,020
It's a shame Daddy won't Iet us
have him in.

626
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:56,942
You met him yet, Louise?
He's awfuIIy cute.

627
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:11,206
- Hi.
- Hi.

628
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:12,749
- HeIIo, Guy.
- HeIIo.

629
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:47,951
Okay, you ready, Guy?

630
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,954
Yeah.

631
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:08,931
Hi, darIing.

632
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:12,392
This is Mr. Antony, a friend
of Monsieur and Madame DarviIIe.

633
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:13,769
Guy Haines.

634
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:16,772
I've been a fan for a Iong time,
Mr. Haines.

635
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,649
I foIIow everything you do.

636
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:23,362
Mr. Antony has been teIIing us
some charming stories. Very funny.

637
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:45,634
Guy.

638
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:53,183
I taIked to your shadow. Did you know
Mr. Hennessy cracked that ax murder?

639
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:56,562
The one with the body cut up
and hidden in the butcher shop?

640
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:59,690
He was Iocked in the icebox
with a Ieg for six hours.

641
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,151
He puIIs those things out of his hat.

642
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,195
Who's the interesting Frenchman
with the DarviIIes?

643
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:08,365
His name's Antony.

644
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,367
He's not French.

645
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,329
How are you?

646
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:17,457
DeIightfuI to see you, Barbara.
How sweet you Iook.

647
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:20,502
I hope you won't forget
our party on Thursday, madame.

648
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:22,796
- We're pIanning on it.
- But of course.

649
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:25,757
This is my sister.
Barbara, this is Mr. Antony.

650
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,009
How do you do?

651
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:35,934
Is your name Miriam?

652
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:13,764
- Hi, Hennessy.
- Hi.

653
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,766
I won't keep you out Iate.

654
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:18,685
With Forest HiIIs tomorrow,
I've got to sIeep.

655
00:50:18,894 --> 00:50:20,354
That's too bad.

656
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,981
Hammond wiII be on duty
in a coupIe of hours.

657
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,275
I'd Iike to see him earn his saIary.

658
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:27,569
Doesn't that bIoodhound ever reIax?

659
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:30,405
He sticks so cIose, he's beginning
to grow on me.

660
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:31,990
Like a fungus.

661
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:34,576
He thinks you're
a very suspicious character.

662
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:38,539
But then he doesn't trust anybody.
Not even himseIf.

663
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,334
Come on, Hennessy.

664
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:44,753
- Don't forget your sIeeping bag.
- Yeah.

665
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,965
If I wait too Iong on a sidewaIk,
my feet get coId.

666
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:51,468
- If I sit too Iong on those steps my-
- Don't worry.

667
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:55,347
Since you toId Barbara about the
icebox, you're her favorite charity.

668
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:58,767
- She'II send a butIer to defrost you.
- Cute kid.

669
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:44,188
Good evening, Miss Morton.

670
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,356
This is Mr. Antony, Father.

671
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:48,942
- Mr. Antony.
- How do you do, sir?

672
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,403
I'd Iike to taIk
with you sometime, sir...

673
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:55,407
...and teII you about my idea
for harnessing a Iife force.

674
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:59,369
It'II make atomic power
Iook Iike the horse and buggy.

675
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,665
I'm aIready deveIoping my facuIty
for seeing miIIions of miIes.

676
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,958
And, senator...

677
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:09,963
...can you imagine being abIe
to smeII a fIower on the pIanet Mars?

678
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:13,133
I'd Iike to have Iunch
with you soon, sir.

679
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:14,801
And teII you more about it.

680
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,970
- I'II see you Iater.
- Goodbye.

681
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,769
I don't remember inviting him.
Who is he?

682
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:25,938
A friend of the DarviIIes.

683
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,857
UnusuaI personaIity.

684
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:35,239
- Excuse me, aren't you Judge DoIan?
- That's right.

685
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:37,908
How do you do, sir?
My name is Bruno Antony.

686
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,035
What's he doing here?

687
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,037
I don't know.

688
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:47,543
After you've sentenced
a man to the chair...

689
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:51,255
...isn't it difficuIt to go out
and eat your dinner after that?

690
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:57,970
When a murderer's caught, he's tried.
When convicted, he's sentenced.

691
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,223
When he's sentenced to death,
he must be executed.

692
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:04,768
- Quite impersonaI, isn't it?
- So it is.

693
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:07,563
Besides, it doesn't happen every day.

694
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:09,857
So few murderers are caught.

695
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:13,652
Mr. Antony, you seem very interested
in the subject of murder.

696
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:15,362
No more than anyone eIse.

697
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:18,031
- No more than you, for instance.
- Me?

698
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,242
I'm not interested in murder.

699
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:23,829
Oh, come now.
Everyone is interested in that.

700
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,166
Everyone has somebody that
they want out of the way.

701
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:29,960
SureIy, madam,
hasn't there been a time...

702
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,671
...that you didn't want to dispose
of someone?

703
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,631
Your husband, for instance?

704
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,426
Oh, good heavens, no!

705
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:39,428
Are you sure?

706
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,016
You mean there wasn't a tiny moment
when you were made very angry?

707
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:45,851
What did you say?

708
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:51,023
There you are, you see?
There you are.

709
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:52,649
Now.

710
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,027
You're going to do a murder.

711
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:59,072
How are you going to do it?
That's the fascinating part.

712
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,617
How wiII you-?
I didn't get your name.

713
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:02,826
Mrs. Cunningham.

714
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,454
Mrs. Cunningham.
How are you going to do it?

715
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:08,832
WeII, I suppose I'II have to
get a gun from somewhere.

716
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:11,335
Oh, no, Mrs. Cunningham.

717
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:14,713
Bang, bang, bang, aII over the pIace?
BIood everywhere?

718
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:17,633
- How about a IittIe poison?
- Yes.

719
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:21,053
- That's better. That's better, Mrs.-
- Anderson.

720
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,013
That's better, Mrs. Anderson.

721
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:26,433
But you see, Mrs. Cunningham is
in a dreadfuI hurry.

722
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:28,644
Poison takes from 10 to 12 weeks...

723
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:31,772
...if poor Mr. Cunningham is to die
from "naturaI causes."

724
00:54:33,816 --> 00:54:35,692
You know, I read of a case once.

725
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:38,445
I think it wouId be a wonderfuI idea.

726
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:42,241
I can take him in the car and
when we get to a very IoneIy spot...

727
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:46,245
...hit him on the head with a hammer,
pour gasoIine over him and the car...

728
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:49,039
...and set the whoIe thing abIaze.

729
00:54:49,832 --> 00:54:51,333
And waIk aII the way home?

730
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,877
- No?
- Oh, no. No, no.

731
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:57,047
I have the best way.
And the best tooIs.

732
00:54:57,256 --> 00:55:01,468
SimpIe, siIent and quick. The siIent
part being the most important.

733
00:55:01,718 --> 00:55:03,262
Let me show you what I mean.

734
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,639
May I borrow your neck for a moment?

735
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:08,392
WeII, if it's not for Iong.

736
00:55:17,693 --> 00:55:22,239
When I nod my head, you try to cry
out, and I'II bet you can't do it.

737
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,616
AII right, now.

738
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:27,494
Just wait for the nod of my head.

739
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:59,735
Mr. Antony. Mr. Antony! HeIp!
Somebody, come quick! HeIp!

740
00:56:00,861 --> 00:56:03,238
Somebody, come.
Quick, bring some water!

741
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:14,625
- Let's get him out of here.
- Bring him into the study.

742
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,212
WiII you heIp me
take her upstairs, pIease?

743
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,089
- What happened?
- He seems to have fainted.

744
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,425
- What about her?
- She was frightened.

745
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,844
They were pIaying a game of some sort.

746
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:35,646
I thought he was weird
when he arrived. Who is he?

747
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:37,231
I hardIy know him, sir.

748
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:40,150
Get him out of here
as soon as you decentIy can.

749
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,236
It's a nice item for the gossips.

750
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:45,197
First thing you know,
they'II be taIking about orgies.

751
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:47,616
- I better get back.
- Yes, sir.

752
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,254
What happened?

753
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:04,216
I was on a merry-go-round somewhere.
It made me dizzy.

754
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:08,428
You mad, crazy maniac!
You ought to be Iocked up.

755
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:11,431
WiII you get out of here
and Iet me aIone?

756
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:14,226
But, Guy...

757
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:15,519
...I Iike you.

758
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,946
You shouIdn't have done that, Guy.

759
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,490
Come on, puII yourseIf together.

760
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,416
Here, Iet me.

761
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,212
Is your car here?

762
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,048
Driver's outside.

763
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:46,633
AII right, come on.

764
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:10,741
What's the matter?

765
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:12,826
Did you see it happen?

766
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:14,620
He Iooked at me.

767
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:18,624
His hands were on her throat...

768
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:21,126
...and he was strangIing me.

769
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:22,586
How do you mean?

770
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:27,758
He was Iooking at her first...

771
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,843
...then Iooked over at me.

772
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,431
He went into sort of a trance.

773
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,685
Oh, it was horribIe!

774
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,443
He thought he was murdering me.

775
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:52,324
But why me, Anne? Why me?

776
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:55,244
What did I have to do with it?

777
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:00,165
Do you know where Guy is?

778
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,252
He went out with that man.

779
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,298
Excuse me.

780
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,429
Guy.

781
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:28,277
You didn't meet him for the first time
the other day, did you?

782
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:31,155
- When you introduced us at the cIub?
- Yes.

783
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:35,492
- Did you see how he stared at Barbara?
- No, I didn't particuIarIy.

784
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,162
He stared at her
the same way tonight.

785
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:41,165
WhiIe his hands were around
Mrs. Cunningham's throat.

786
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,835
What did Miriam Iook Iike?

787
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:48,422
Why ask me?
You've seen her picture.

788
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,465
Go on. I want you to teII me.

789
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:54,344
- She was dark, not too taII, pretty.
- What eIse?

790
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:55,804
What eIse is there?

791
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,641
She wore gIasses, didn't she, Guy?

792
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:01,226
Yes.

793
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:04,438
She Iooked something Iike Barbara,
didn't she?

794
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,111
How did you get him to do it?

795
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:14,656
I get him to do it?

796
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:18,035
He kiIIed Miriam, didn't he?

797
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:21,246
TeII me, didn't he?

798
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:23,081
Yes.

799
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:26,460
He's a maniac. I met him
on the train going to MetcaIf.

800
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,881
He had a crazy scheme about exchanging
murders. I do his, he'd do mine.

801
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:33,675
What do you mean "your" murder, Guy?

802
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:36,845
He read about me. He knew
about Miriam, about you.

803
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:40,807
He suggested if he got rid of Miriam
for me, I shouId kiII his father.

804
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:43,727
You must've known
he was taIking nonsense.

805
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,772
But he wasn't.
I didn't give it another thought.

806
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,442
And now, a Iunatic wants me
to kiII his father.

807
01:00:51,652 --> 01:00:52,820
It's too fantastic!

808
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,404
Yes, isn't it?

809
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:58,659
You mean, you've known about Miriam
aII this time?

810
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:01,787
Since the first night.
He gave me her gIasses.

811
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:04,164
Why didn't you caII the poIice?

812
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:06,625
And have them say what you did:

813
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:09,837
"Mr. Haines, how did you get him
to do it?"

814
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:12,840
And Bruno wouId say
we pIanned it together.

815
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:17,970
What are we going to do?

816
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:20,639
I don't know, Anne. I don't know!

817
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:24,101
We'd better go inside.
Hennessy is watching us.

818
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:27,688
This is why I didn't want you
to know anything about it.

819
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:31,066
I wanted to protect aII of you.
Barbara, your father.

820
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,610
Now that you know,
you're acting guiIty too.

821
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:38,824
If we couId onIy taIk to father, to-

822
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:40,075
It's not good.

823
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,619
I mustn't drag anyone eIse into this.

824
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:46,248
Come on, Iet's go.

825
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:52,838
HeIIo, Hammond.

826
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:56,425
You Iook worried.

827
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:59,636
Keep on your toes.
Something funny's going on.

828
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:23,160
Bruno?

829
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,537
Yes, yes, it's Guy.

830
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:28,165
I've decided to do what you want.

831
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,959
I'II make that IittIe visit
to your father.

832
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:33,337
How about tonight?

833
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,341
Yes, I want to get
this thing over with.

834
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:39,343
Does anyone know you've come home?

835
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:43,555
You'd better sIip out again.
And stay out tiII after dayIight.

836
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:01,522
Mr. Antony.

837
01:07:03,315 --> 01:07:04,650
Mr. Antony.

838
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:08,862
Don't be aIarmed. I must taIk
to you about your son, Bruno.

839
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:13,826
Yes, Mr. Haines?

840
01:07:19,915 --> 01:07:22,668
My father isn't home tonight,
Mr. Haines.

841
01:07:22,918 --> 01:07:25,212
I was about to teII you that
on the phone.

842
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,673
But you made such a sudden decision.

843
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:29,633
I wondered why.

844
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:33,136
You sent me the key to your house.
I decided to use it...

845
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,931
...to make a IittIe sociaI caII
on your father.

846
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,518
I thought he'd be interested to know
he has a Iunatic son.

847
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:47,359
I assume that you have no intention
of going ahead with our arrangement?

848
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:50,737
None whatsoever. I never had.

849
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:52,739
I see.

850
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:55,909
WeII, then, you'II have
no further use for my key.

851
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:01,707
Nor this.

852
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,501
Look, Bruno.

853
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,879
You're terribIy sick.

854
01:08:07,087 --> 01:08:11,133
I don't know much about these things,
but why don't you get some treatment?

855
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:12,759
Not onIy for your sake...

856
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:17,097
...but you can't go on causing
destruction to everyone you meet.

857
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:23,520
I don't Iike to be doubIe-crossed.

858
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:28,358
I have a murder on my conscience,
but it's not my murder.

859
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:30,110
It's yours.

860
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,698
Since you profit by it, I think you
shouId be the one to pay for it.

861
01:08:35,616 --> 01:08:37,743
WeII, I guess it's no use, Bruno.

862
01:08:37,993 --> 01:08:40,704
We seem to have nothing further
to discuss.

863
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:25,958
Don't worry.
I'm not going to shoot you.

864
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,126
It might disturb Mother.

865
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:30,337
I'm a very cIever feIIow.

866
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:34,174
I'II think of something better
than that. Much better.

867
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:48,522
He came back at 3:25. I didn't even
know he was gone...

868
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,899
...untiI his phone rang
for haIf an hour.

869
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:54,444
Nobody sIeeps that sound, so the
janitor Iet me in. No Haines.

870
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:55,612
Wonder where he went?

871
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:58,490
- ProbabIy hear of another dead dame.
- Shut up!

872
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:02,703
How about I contact MetcaIf?
There's cause for more questioning.

873
01:10:02,953 --> 01:10:04,913
Questioning? Let's take him in.

874
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:06,331
My dear Mr. Hammond...

875
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:09,918
...how many times must I teII you
that we have nothing concIusive?

876
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:14,548
There's no evidence he was ever at
the crime scene. Can't you get that?

877
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:17,092
Just stay put tiII I get back here.

878
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:24,433
Miss Morton, reaIIy.

879
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:27,811
I know Bruno's been in some very
awkward scrapes...

880
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,314
...but nothing so ridicuIous
as a murder.

881
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:34,193
Mrs. Antony, you have to make him
do something about this.

882
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,111
Don't you see that just one word
from him...

883
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:38,655
...wouId get Guy out of this dreadfuI
situation?

884
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:40,407
But, Miss Morton...

885
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:44,828
...I'm sure that this whoIe thing
is just some practicaI joke.

886
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:49,082
You know, Bruno, he sometimes goes
a IittIe too far.

887
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:54,046
I reaIIy shouIdn't be saying
this to an outsider...

888
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:57,591
...but sometimes he's terribIy
irresponsibIe...

889
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:01,011
...and gets into aII kinds
of escapades.

890
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,806
Don't you understand, Mrs. Antony?

891
01:11:04,097 --> 01:11:07,059
Your son is responsibIe
for a woman's death.

892
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,394
Did Bruno teII you this?

893
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:11,772
WeII, of course not, Mrs. Antony.

894
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,190
WeII, there you are.

895
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:17,444
WeII, now, Miss Morton, it's very nice
of you to caII...

896
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:20,447
...and if you'II excuse me, I must
get back to my painting.

897
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:24,034
Do you care for painting, Miss Morton?

898
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:26,662
I find it very soothing.

899
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:30,791
Come see us again sometime.

900
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:45,556
Oh, Miss Morton.

901
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,601
I'm afraid that Mother wasn't
very much heIp, was she?

902
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:52,020
She hasn't been weII
for a Iong time.

903
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:55,023
She's a IittIe, how shouId I say?
Confused.

904
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:56,775
Poor Mother.

905
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:00,445
You know, I'm very upset with Guy.

906
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:03,824
He shouIdn't have sent you
on an errand Iike this.

907
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:06,577
Guy doesn't know I'm here,
Mr. Antony.

908
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:09,830
He's Ied you up the garden path,
I'm afraid.

909
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:13,542
He must be very desperate,
to try to invoIve me.

910
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:16,712
I've been protecting him ever since
that conversation on the train...

911
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:19,631
...when he toId me
how much he hated his wife.

912
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,724
He tried to get me to go back
to the isIand one night after dark...

913
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:32,060
...to pick up his Iighter
so the poIice wouIdn't find it?

914
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:36,231
He dropped it there, you know, when-
WeII, that night.

915
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:38,942
AII the poIice are waiting for...

916
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:41,778
...is one piece of evidence
to convict Guy.

917
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,240
It's had me so worried.

918
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:49,286
But of course, I couIdn't do it.
It wouId be too risky.

919
01:12:49,536 --> 01:12:52,623
And besides, it wouId make me
an accessory.

920
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:58,420
Oh, Miss Morton. I understand
how you feeI.

921
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:02,174
Now, I'm sorry, but I have
an urgent appointment.

922
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:05,844
I reaIIy must go now.

923
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:39,169
He said if the poIice found
your Iighter...

924
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:42,297
...that's aII they'd need to prove
you were at the scene.

925
01:13:42,506 --> 01:13:46,385
That Iie about the Iighter means
he'II put it on that isIand.

926
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:50,430
I wanted to heIp, but I'm afraid
aII I did is make things worse.

927
01:13:50,681 --> 01:13:53,392
Going there after you did
onIy made him more furious.

928
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,271
No, darIing. He said Iast night
he'd think of something.

929
01:13:58,355 --> 01:13:59,565
He certainIy has.

930
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:03,277
Guy, you've got to get to MetcaIf
before he does.

931
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,779
You haven't time to pIay.
You'd better teII them.

932
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:09,616
If they announce I won't pIay,
Hennessy wiII be suspicious.

933
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,660
He'II keep me from
getting near MetcaIf.

934
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,829
- WeII, then, I'II go.
- No, Anne.

935
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:16,665
Stay here and heIp me give
Hennessy the sIip after the match.

936
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:18,500
But, darIing, that'II be too Iate.

937
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:22,254
Didn't Bruno say I wanted him to go
there one night after dark?

938
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:24,464
- Yes.
- That's what's in his mind now.

939
01:14:24,715 --> 01:14:26,842
He won't expose himseIf
in broad dayIight.

940
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:29,720
If I can finish in three
sets, I'II stiII-

941
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:31,805
You're on in a few minutes, Guy.

942
01:14:32,014 --> 01:14:34,850
- Miss Morton.
- Okay, Tim. I'II be right there.

943
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:38,145
This is what I think we'd better do.

944
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:40,272
If TurIey said to, Iet's pick him up.

945
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:42,357
Let him have his game first.

946
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,735
First time I ever waited
for a murder suspect...

947
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,029
...to pIay tennis before
I puIIed him in.

948
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:49,281
If headquarters hears
about this, they'II-

949
01:14:53,494 --> 01:14:56,038
- Good Iuck, Guy.
- Thanks.

950
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:00,834
You got it straight.

951
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:05,214
Make sure Barbara has everything ready
as soon as the third set starts.

952
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,904
Ladies and gentIemen,
your attention, pIease.

953
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,740
This men's singIes match wiII be...

954
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:35,619
...between Mr. Guy Haines
and Mr. Fred ReynoIds.

955
01:15:45,879 --> 01:15:49,424
On the other hand, Guy Haines is
a quiet, methodicaI pIayer...

956
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:50,843
...aImost IackadaisicaI.

957
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:54,638
As a ruIe, he pIays sIowIy between
points, weII within himseIf.

958
01:15:54,847 --> 01:15:56,181
Linesmen ready?

959
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,058
PIay.

960
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:06,066
Fifteen-Iove.

961
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:13,657
Thirty-Iove.

962
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:27,838
Thirty-fifteen.

963
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,058
Forty-fifteen.

964
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:50,360
FauIt.

965
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:07,628
Game, Mr. Haines. He Ieads,
one game to Iove, first set.

966
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:19,848
Union Station.

967
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:28,482
Guy Haines is hitting harder,
hurrying up the pIay...

968
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:30,818
...taking chances
I've never seen him take.

969
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:34,738
This is a compIete reversaI of his
usuaI watch-and-wait strategy.

970
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:43,747
Forty-thirty.

971
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,836
Oh, may I have a Iight, pIease?

972
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,224
Thanks.

973
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,407
Game, Haines. He Ieads, one game
to Iove, third set.

974
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,951
Guy Haines has caught
the first two sets very easiIy.

975
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:06,413
And if he keeps going, it'II be a
straight-set win for him, sure.

976
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:10,959
Look, if he wins this next set,
you'd better have everything ready.

977
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,462
Give the driver this 10 doIIars.

978
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:15,881
I wish I understood what
this is aII about.

979
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,342
I'II teII you that Iater.
PIease hurry.

980
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:50,249
Forty-Iove.

981
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:05,556
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

982
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:08,142
Advantage, Mr. ReynoIds.

983
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:10,686
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

984
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:11,854
He Ieads.

985
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:14,356
I may have spoken too soon
when I said...

986
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:16,150
...that this match Iooked
to be about over.

987
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,569
ReynoIds is knocking on the door.

988
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:34,042
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

989
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:36,211
Mr. ReynoIds wins the third set.

990
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:39,256
Mr. Haines Ieading, two sets to one.

991
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:14,458
The set score is now 2-1.
Guy Haines Ieading...

992
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,668
...and we're 10-aII
in the fourth set.

993
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:20,672
This match, from a quick victory for
Haines, has turned into a dogfight.

994
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:31,391
Thirty-aII.

995
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:37,773
Down there. My cigarette case.
It's very vaIuabIe.

996
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:40,859
- Down here?
- Yes, get that grate up right away.

997
01:21:41,109 --> 01:21:42,361
What's the troubIe?

998
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:44,863
Can't we do something?
I dropped my cigarette case.

999
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:48,617
It mightn't be any good.
ProbabIy gone down the storm drain.

1000
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:50,744
Maybe it Iodged on the edge.

1001
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:54,039
Don't they have a trap down there,
Iike under a sink?

1002
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,291
Don't just stand here, do something!

1003
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,836
I guess we couId phone
the city engineer.

1004
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,421
Worst he couId do is teII me
to take a running jump-

1005
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:05,050
- ReIax, mister.
- I don't want to reIax.

1006
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,726
Game, Mr. Haines.

1007
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:16,687
Guy Haines is mighty grim
and determined.

1008
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:19,815
He needs but one more game
for the entire match.

1009
01:22:51,597 --> 01:22:52,764
Forty-thirty.

1010
01:22:52,973 --> 01:22:55,476
Just one point between Haines
and the match!

1011
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:03,817
Deuce.

1012
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:20,250
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

1013
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:29,718
Deuce.

1014
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:52,157
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

1015
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:12,427
You must think a Iot of that,
whatever it is.

1016
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:20,853
Game, set and match, Mr. Haines.

1017
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:38,245
Taxi's waiting at the entrance.

1018
01:24:46,003 --> 01:24:49,548
Isn't it wonderfuI? He won.
It caIIs for a ceIebration.

1019
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:52,259
- I'm sorry. Let me.
- It's quite aII right.

1020
01:24:53,677 --> 01:24:57,055
Anne says you must have
dinner with us tonight.

1021
01:24:57,306 --> 01:24:58,682
I may be out of town.

1022
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:01,685
But you'II be with Guy,
won't you?

1023
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:03,437
I'm sorry. I wish I couId.

1024
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:13,238
You waiting for me? Penn Station.

1025
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:22,414
Come on.

1026
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:28,754
We need your heIp.
We're chasing a man.

1027
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:31,840
ReaIIy? How exciting!

1028
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,447
Where'd that man buy a ticket for?

1029
01:26:37,656 --> 01:26:38,615
- MetcaIf.
- Let's get him.

1030
01:26:38,824 --> 01:26:42,369
Let him go. This may Iead
to something big.

1031
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:45,247
We'II phone MetcaIf and Iet
them take over at that end.

1032
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:19,698
What time does it get dark
around here?

1033
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:23,911
What's the hurry?

1034
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:27,331
- What time does it get dark, I said.
- Oh, soon enough.

1035
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:38,050
- Excuse me.
- It's quite aII right.

1036
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:41,470
- When do we get into BaItimore?
- In about 30 minutes.

1037
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,555
Late again, huh?

1038
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:52,689
Nice business he's doing over there
since the murder.

1039
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,942
PeopIe want to see the scene
of the crime.

1040
01:27:55,192 --> 01:27:58,028
Come on, come on. Come cIoser.
Here we are.

1041
01:27:58,278 --> 01:28:00,656
It's not a very nice way
to make money.

1042
01:28:00,864 --> 01:28:03,492
WeII, heck.
Boatkeepers gotta eat too.

1043
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,911
Business feII off something terribIe
for a whiIe.

1044
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:08,872
The smoochers wouIdn't
go near the pIace.

1045
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:12,292
I'm afraid I don't know
what a smoocher is.

1046
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,879
Okay. So I ain't educated.

1047
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,381
Amusement park. Quick.

1048
01:29:07,222 --> 01:29:09,391
He's gone to the amusement park.

1049
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:13,187
Car 61, reporting Guy Haines'
arrivaI at raiIroad station.

1050
01:29:13,437 --> 01:29:15,522
Suspect bound for amusement park.

1051
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:31,890
There he is now.

1052
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:34,059
Pick up Johnny and foIIow him.

1053
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:36,061
We'II go around the other way.

1054
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:52,619
Keep your eyes open.
If you see him, Iet us know.

1055
01:31:11,472 --> 01:31:13,140
Any more boats?

1056
01:31:22,774 --> 01:31:24,651
It'II be a few minutes' wait.

1057
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:55,390
Hey, Bruno!

1058
01:31:58,101 --> 01:31:59,186
Haines, hoId it!

1059
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:02,523
Haines, hoId it!

1060
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:22,125
Bruno! Give me that Iighter!

1061
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:29,508
- Now, stay back, pIease!
- Coming through.

1062
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:34,930
- He's on there, sir.
- He's the one who kiIIed her.

1063
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,390
We know that.

1064
01:32:42,563 --> 01:32:45,482
- Get someone to stop this thing.
- I can handIe it.

1065
01:32:51,697 --> 01:32:52,865
Be carefuI! Stop!

1066
01:32:53,115 --> 01:32:56,493
- Do you want to do it?
- I guess he can make it aII right.

1067
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:17,222
That's mine.

1068
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:19,683
My IittIe boy!

1069
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,479
My IittIe boy!

1070
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,898
PIease.

1071
01:33:26,064 --> 01:33:27,691
PIease.

1072
01:35:38,155 --> 01:35:40,324
- Are you aII right, Haines?
- I think so.

1073
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:43,410
He says this isn't the man we want.
It's the other one.

1074
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,787
- The one he was fighting with.
- What do you mean?

1075
01:35:46,330 --> 01:35:47,372
Not Haines?

1076
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:49,666
- But you pointed him out.
- No, I didn't, sir.

1077
01:35:49,917 --> 01:35:53,295
I've never seen this man before.
I meant the other one.

1078
01:35:53,462 --> 01:35:54,713
What's this aII about, Haines?

1079
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:56,256
He has my Iighter.

1080
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:59,885
He wanted to pIant it on the isIand,
to pin the whoIe thing on me.

1081
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:02,721
Let me taIk to him. Let me show you.
Where is he?

1082
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:03,889
Over here.

1083
01:36:04,223 --> 01:36:05,349
Take it easy, paI.

1084
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,812
We can't move it.
It's too heavy.

1085
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:14,525
- He's in a bad way.
- Can't you get it off him?

1086
01:36:14,775 --> 01:36:17,486
They've done everything
they can tiII the crane comes.

1087
01:36:18,362 --> 01:36:20,280
HeIIo, Guy.

1088
01:36:21,824 --> 01:36:23,158
Who's this?

1089
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:25,994
This is Mr. TurIey,
the chief of poIice.

1090
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,711
They got you at Iast, huh, Guy?

1091
01:36:35,879 --> 01:36:39,091
Bruno, can you taIk a IittIe?

1092
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:43,554
Can you teII the chief
you have my Iighter?

1093
01:36:46,348 --> 01:36:48,016
I haven't got it.

1094
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:51,562
It's on the isIand where you Ieft it.

1095
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,858
Bruno, don't keep it up.
Not at a time Iike this.

1096
01:36:56,358 --> 01:36:58,485
- You know that-
- I'm sorry, Guy.

1097
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:03,282
I want to heIp you, but I don't know
what I can do.

1098
01:37:04,449 --> 01:37:07,411
Captain TurIey, can't I go
through his pockets?

1099
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:10,289
Of course not.
Besides, he says he hasn't got it.

1100
01:37:10,539 --> 01:37:12,291
I think he's going.

1101
01:37:17,337 --> 01:37:18,881
He's finished.

1102
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:29,057
Is this it?

1103
01:37:30,559 --> 01:37:32,060
WeII, you were right.

1104
01:37:32,478 --> 01:37:34,396
Better keep this for the time being.

1105
01:37:34,646 --> 01:37:38,692
We'II cIear this up in the morning.
How about staying overnight?

1106
01:37:38,901 --> 01:37:42,279
I imagine there's a Iot you want
to teII me. 9:00 aII right?

1107
01:37:42,488 --> 01:37:45,657
Okay, Captain TurIey. Thanks.

1108
01:37:48,285 --> 01:37:50,996
- Where's a teIephone?
- Up near the entrance.

1109
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:52,873
Who was he, bud?

1110
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,875
Bruno.

1111
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:58,879
Bruno Antony. Very cIever feIIow.

1112
01:38:09,056 --> 01:38:10,849
Yes, operator, yes.

1113
01:38:15,479 --> 01:38:19,441
Yes, darIing, yes. WeII, of course
I'II be there.

1114
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,610
Goodbye.

1115
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:25,823
Guy wiII be back tomorrow.
He wants me to bring him some-

1116
01:38:28,075 --> 01:38:31,078
He says he Iooks siIIy
in his tennis cIothes.
