1
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:04,328
So, this "Naomi"
has been controlling you

2
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:05,980
since she got you
out of Purgatory?

3
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:06,475
Yes.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,680
So you just want to
guide me out of Purgatory

5
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,232
out of the goodness
of your undead heart?

6
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:11,366
More or less.

7
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:13,785
What's in it for you?
I'm hopping a ride.

8
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:14,953
What?

9
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,188
It's a human portal,
jackass.

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,324
Only humans
can pass through.

11
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,159
He's a <i>vampire.</i>
He's also the reason I'm topside.

12
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:22,911
I know you had to do
what you had to down there.

13
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:25,046
But you're out now,
and Benny's still breathing.

14
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:26,414
Why?
Listen, Benny,

15
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,367
everything you've done for me
I will never forget.

16
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,202
End of the line?
End of the line.

17
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,054
God built a series of tests.

18
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,173
When you've done all three,
you can slam the Gates.

19
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:36,758
Sam,
I didn't pass a test.

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,410
But I did. And I'm doing
the rest of them.

21
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:39,561
You got to slow down.
No.

22
00:00:39,563 --> 00:00:41,363
You said nuking hell --
that's how I get out.

23
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:42,647
That's how I go home.

24
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:43,881
I need this to be over.

25
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,219
Kevin.

26
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:49,904
Kevin.

27
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,490
I know what you're up to...

28
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:55,994
Working with them,
those Winchesters.

29
00:00:55,996 --> 00:00:58,813
Dead end, Kevin.

30
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:02,233
Not here.

31
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,754
Not here, either.

32
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:08,089
Give up.

33
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:13,628
I'm in your head,
as well as everywhere else.

34
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:20,552
Last time you irked me,
you lost a finger.

35
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:22,937
Imagine what will happen
this time.

40
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:51,536
Kevin!

41
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,208
Whoa! Whoa.

42
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,510
Geez. What's going on?
What's with the S.O.S.?

43
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,779
It's him.

44
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,247
It's who?

45
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,466
Crowley.

46
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,001
What about him?

47
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:08,270
He's in my head.

48
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:10,772
He's...in your head.

49
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:12,307
Do you know
what that means?

50
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:14,559
Yeah, it means we need
to up your anxiety meds.

51
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:15,861
Kevin, you're dreaming.

52
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:17,279
Look, if Crowley knew
where you were,

53
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,648
he'd do a hell of a lot more
than mess with your head.

54
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,832
All right, where's Garth?

55
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,068
On a case or -- or the dentist.
I don't know.

56
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,604
I haven't heard from him.
Okay, well, what did you want to tell us

57
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:26,938
that you
couldn't say on the phone?

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,740
Would you put the frying pan
down, please?

59
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:36,448
I translated the second trial
from the tablet.

60
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,970
You...crazy Prophet, you.
Nice work!

61
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:45,140
And if Crowley's in my head,
he knows.

62
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:47,642
Okay, he's definitely not in your head.
He's not in your head, Kevin.

63
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:48,894
It's okay. Just...

64
00:02:48,896 --> 00:02:51,430
We know you're distressed.
Just stay with us, all right?

65
00:02:51,432 --> 00:02:52,764
What's the second trial?

66
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,633
An innocent soul
has to be rescued from Hell

67
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:57,235
and delivered unto Heaven.

68
00:02:57,237 --> 00:02:58,887
What?

69
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,690
"Unto." That's --
that's how God talks.

70
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:04,993
Rescue a soul from Hell?
Like actually...Go to Hell?

71
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,878
How -- how do you get a soul
unto Heaven?

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,498
I mean, how do you even
get a soul out of Hell?

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,917
We're gonna need
an expert.

74
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:25,013
Winchesters.

75
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:31,136
What happened
to the hot chicks?

76
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:33,605
I'm out of here.

77
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:35,974
Maybe not.

78
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:47,252
I ain't got nothing.

79
00:03:47,254 --> 00:03:48,570
Oh?

80
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:49,905
Bite me.

81
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:51,523
Well, then how about
another owie?

82
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,359
Ohh!

83
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,461
You know, wouldn't it be
a lot easier

84
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:59,998
just to tell us how to enter
Hell, uh, uninvited?

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,250
It's...a secret.

86
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:04,186
We promise
we won't tell anyone.

87
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:11,309
No! Wait. I can't.

88
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:13,311
It's forbidden, man.

89
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,013
They're gonna kill me.

90
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:24,072
Please...

91
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:28,660
All right, look...

92
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:33,532
For a price, y'all can be
smuggled across Hell's border.

93
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:36,118
By who?
Rogue reapers.

94
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,422
They got secret ways,
in and out.

95
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:44,759
Not just Hell --
the Veil, Heaven.

96
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:46,962
Rogue reapers
smuggling people?

97
00:04:46,964 --> 00:04:48,513
People, souls...

98
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:50,432
So, what?
They're like hell coyotes?

99
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,938
Now kill me.
Come on, man.

100
00:04:58,024 --> 00:04:59,691
Better death than Crowley.

101
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:02,310
Hmm. Good point.

102
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:04,529
But first
you're gonna tell us...

103
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,648
everything.

104
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:30,922
Ajay.

105
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,609
Need to talk to you
for a sec.

106
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:37,229
You know my name.

107
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,130
And what you do.

108
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:42,684
We want to do business.

109
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:44,519
But you are mortal --
flesh and blood.

110
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:47,923
But if we wanted to cross
the border into Hell --

111
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:48,907
visitor's pass.

112
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:51,076
No one
wants to get <i>into</i> Hell.

113
00:05:51,078 --> 00:05:53,612
But could a coyote like you
do it?

114
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,597
It's possible.

115
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:58,350
But I have special skills.

116
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:00,969
I have overhead.
It will be pricy.

117
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:03,054
How pricey?

118
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,156
You two are resourceful.

119
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,808
One day,
you will owe me a favor.

120
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,360
You say that
like you know us.

121
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:11,229
Of course.
You're the Winchesters.

122
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:13,131
Sorry. Have we met?

123
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:16,167
I am the reaper
who took Bobby Singer to Hell.

124
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:20,789
Bobby in Hell?

125
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,908
We burned his bones.
Once we did that, it was over.

126
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,060
End of story.
Hmm...

127
00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,561
Not necessarily.

128
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:28,813
No, no, no, 'cause, see, Bobby
was on the good side of things,

129
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,815
and good guys
go to the penthouse.

130
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:32,284
Usually, mostly.

131
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:35,854
Depends on who you know,
what palms get greased.

132
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:38,056
If you're on the King of Hell's
no-fly list,

133
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:40,542
no way you cruise
the friendly skies.

134
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:42,928
Crowley.

135
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,082
Okay, let's do this.

136
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,817
How much for two tickets down
and three back?

137
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,552
Dean.
What?

138
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:52,053
Come here.

139
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,890
What the hell
are you thinking?

140
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:57,375
You heard the guy --
Bobby's in Hell.

141
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:58,727
We're gonna spring him.

142
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,129
We've gone over this, Dean.
I have to do the trials solo.

143
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,981
This is Bobby
we're talking about, Sam.

144
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,215
Now let's face it --

145
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:07,285
you have not exactly been
up to full speed lately, okay?

146
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,187
We got one shot at this.
We can't miss.

147
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:12,023
I'm not gonna miss.

148
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,909
I'll bring him back.

149
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,444
I'm in, just me.

150
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,697
Follow me.

151
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,415
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

152
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,000
How does this...Work?

153
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:23,201
Not to fret.

154
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:26,404
He'll be back
in exactly 24 hours time.

155
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:28,306
Return for him then.

156
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,873
Take my hand.

157
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,028
And it gets creepier.

158
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,574
So, this is Hell?

159
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:56,378
Not at all.
This is Purgatory.

160
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,612
What do you mean
this is Purgatory?

161
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,465
This isn't what I paid for.
I booked the Hell tour.

162
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,699
Whoa, whoa, Winchester,
detach.

163
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:14,047
This is Hell-adjacent.

164
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,082
Been down this highway
many times before.

165
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,479
Follow the stream to where
three trees meet as one.

166
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,498
Where they meet,
there are rocks.

167
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:24,836
Between the rocks
is the portal.

168
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,140
A portal?

169
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,338
A back door to Hell.
Trust me -- it'll work.

170
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,506
Wait. So you're not
coming with me?

171
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,792
Don't be ridiculous.

172
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:36,212
Smuggling a mortal across
the border is risky enough.

173
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:39,932
But gate-crashing a Winchester
into Hell seriously blows.

174
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:45,588
No. I'll be back in 24 hours,
precisely.

175
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:47,973
Be here.

176
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:59,151
It's a good thing
you brought that.

177
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,853
It is not
an easy place.

178
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:16,852
Yo, Kev, it's me!

179
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,508
Kevin.

180
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,863
I believe the closet
would be safest.

181
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,231
Safe from what?

182
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:30,399
Crowley.

183
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:33,051
He's in my head, Dean.

184
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,653
And if he's in my head,
he knows where I am!

185
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,739
You know,
we -- we should move out.

186
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:38,190
We'll find another place.

187
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,526
Geez, Kev,
would you chill out, huh?

188
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,529
Have a burger.

189
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,068
Come on.
Don't lose it on me now, dude.

190
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:53,088
There you go.
That's it.

191
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,742
Just tell me
when this all ends,

192
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:58,761
'cause that's the only thing
I want to hear.

193
00:11:00,297 --> 00:11:04,767
No, like I told you before,
this isn't going to end.

194
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,590
Look, man, other guys,
they got it easy, you know?

195
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:15,427
It's all backyard barbecues
and...bowling teams,

196
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:16,428
but you and me?

197
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,814
We got to carry
a little extra weight.

198
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:21,600
I can't take it.

199
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:26,939
Yes, you can.

200
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:29,859
Hey, look at me.

201
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:33,012
Now, this whole thing sucks.
I know.

202
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:35,381
But you suck it up

203
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:38,450
and you push through
because that's what we do.

204
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,220
And when you get on board
with that,

205
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:43,088
the ride is a lot smoother.

206
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,759
French fry?

207
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:56,402
I'm gonna --
I'm gonna be in my room.

208
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:58,136
Let me know
when there's a good day.

209
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:00,406
That's my pie.

210
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,960
Hello, Ajay.

211
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:26,682
It's been a while
since we chatted --

212
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:29,552
too long.

213
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:30,886
Pizza?

214
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:32,555
Extra anchovies.

215
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:34,573
Anything you want to
get off your chest?

216
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:36,408
An update?

217
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,410
Um...No.

218
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:40,446
No, not really.

219
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:43,599
As you may recall, patience
isn't one of my virtues.

220
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,452
Well, I don't have any virtues,
but if I did,

221
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,071
I'm certain that patience
wouldn't be one.

222
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:53,876
So, sure there's nothing
weighing on you?

223
00:12:57,747 --> 00:13:02,367
Nothing, say, about making
a deal with the Winchesters?

224
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:06,138
Sir, I know better
than to attempt that.

225
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:11,427
My operative saw you leaving
with Sam Winchester.

226
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:14,546
Oh! Oh, <i>Sam</i> Winchester.

227
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:16,548
Oh, yes, that's, uh...

228
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,851
A possibility.

229
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,603
You're trying
my non-patience.

230
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,621
Sir, I was just doing
what I do.

231
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:24,657
As you are
more than aware,

232
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:28,894
I do occasionally --
moonlight as a freelancer.

233
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,249
You do not freelance
with them.

234
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:36,735
What did Sam want?

235
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:42,791
Well, uh, actually, it's, uh,
starting to come back.

236
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,510
He may have wanted
to get into Hell.

237
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:46,929
My Hell?
Why would he want to do that?

238
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:48,747
I don't know.

239
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:51,050
I swear. My job --
I don't ask questions.

240
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:56,121
And what time is Mr. Winchester
due back from Hell?

241
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:58,774
Uh,
I'm picking him up in...

242
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:01,443
Well, now 17 hours.

243
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,413
I see.
Anything else?

244
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:07,116
No.

245
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,901
I swear.

246
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:11,970
Hmm.

247
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:25,617
That's one fare
you won't be collecting.

248
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:56,208
It's a rabbit hole.
This is nuts.

249
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,781
I'm...innocent.

250
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:12,117
Help me.

251
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:15,170
Eddy? Eddy?

252
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:18,257
Eddy? Eddy?

253
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:20,259
You came.

254
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:21,927
I knew you would.

255
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:24,629
I've been praying for it
forever.

256
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:27,465
I'm not...him.
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,134
You came.

258
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,435
I knew you would.

259
00:17:30,437 --> 00:17:34,323
I've been praying for it.
Forever.

260
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:43,648
You came.
I knew you would.

261
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,352
I've been praying for it
forever.

262
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:05,270
Bobby?

263
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,881
Get the hell out of here,
you black-eyed son of a bitch.

264
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:26,730
What?
Bobby, it's Sam.

265
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,978
Yeah, and I'm Elvis.
Move your ass!

266
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:29,799
Bobby --
get!

267
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,215
It's me!

268
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:33,935
Okay, damn it.
If it's not Sam...

269
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:36,771
Then how do I know all about you
and Tori spelling?

270
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:37,855
What?

271
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:41,392
You're a fan. Yeah.
Or -- or, uh...

272
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:43,995
Okay. What about your free
pedicure at the Mall of America?

273
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,696
You made Dean swear to
never tell another living soul

274
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,466
how it changed your life.

275
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,685
Sam?

276
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:05,549
I'm sorry, Sam, but you're
the 200th Sam I've seen today.

277
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,301
That's
how they screw with me.

278
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:12,356
Just endless Sams and Deans
all wearing the Sam black eyes.

279
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:13,624
Wait a minute.

280
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:15,326
What the hell
are you doing here?

281
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,712
Please don't tell me
it's what I think it is.

282
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:21,682
No, no, no,
Bobby, I'm good. I...

283
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:24,735
I'm here to get you.

284
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,990
You don't belong here,
Bobby.

285
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:31,826
And we're getting you out.

286
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:35,713
Am I the only one who sees
the urgency of this situation?

287
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:39,116
Sir --
Something is going on.

288
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:42,019
My Hellhound
has been killed.

289
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:45,706
Winchester jumbo size is trying
to break into the mother ship.

290
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,693
And that Prophet of theirs
is madly translating away.

291
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:49,961
Add it up!

292
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:51,846
I will, sir.

293
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:58,052
Where did we get you, huh?
Temp agency?

294
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:06,193
I need Kevin Tran, and I need
his half of the tablet.

295
00:20:06,195 --> 00:20:08,813
Apparently,
his half has the good stuff,

296
00:20:08,815 --> 00:20:11,265
where mine has
the acknowledgements

297
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:12,733
and "about the author."

298
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:13,718
It will be done.

299
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,136
It had better be.

300
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:18,322
Find that kid.

301
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:23,110
Hey, Kevin!

302
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,546
Come in here
and grab some of these eggs.

303
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:29,917
Kev! Come on, man.
You can't hide in there forever.

304
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,289
Where the hell you been?

305
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,924
What happened
to being scared?

306
00:20:36,926 --> 00:20:39,593
I <i>am</i> scared.

307
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:40,978
So I made
a preemptive move.

308
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,797
So...

309
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,133
Made a what now?

310
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:49,904
I can't sit here with the tablet
like a...sitting duck

311
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:52,740
and Crowley
breathing down my ass.

312
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:55,793
Getting rid of the tablet just
takes off some of the pressure.

313
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:56,944
Wait.
Getting rid of it?

314
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:58,996
Temporarily. I hid it.

315
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:00,865
What? Where?

316
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:05,236
If I tell you where,
it's not hidden, is it?

317
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:07,988
Kevin, tell me where the damn
tablet is, or I swear to you --

318
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,440
You'll what, Dean?

319
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:14,045
Kevin!

320
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:20,334
Kids. So cute
when they're little.

321
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,920
Then they turn into teenagers,
and the party's over.

322
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:26,607
We haven't been
formally introduced, Dean.

323
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,359
My name is Naomi.

324
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,012
Oh,
I know who you are.

325
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,948
And I know
what you did to Cass

326
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,783
after he got
out of Purgatory.

327
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:38,869
After I <i>rescued</i> him
from Purgatory, you mean,

328
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:41,872
at the cost
of many angels' lives.

329
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:45,576
You screwed with his head
and had him spy on us.

330
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:49,997
Well, it <i>is</i> true that I have
spoken with Castiel many times,

331
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,283
trying to reach out to him,
trying to help him.

332
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:57,204
Dean, you must have noticed
how Purgatory changed him.

333
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:00,024
I mean, he's been unstable
in the past,

334
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:03,344
but I was shocked
at how damaged he is now.

335
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:06,313
Stop, okay?
Don't -- don't try to spin this.

336
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:09,266
You think I don't know that you
told him to try and kill me?

337
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:11,318
Hmm.

338
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,554
Yeah, I suppose
that <i>is</i> how he would hear it.

339
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:16,957
When I learned
of the Angel tablet,

340
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:20,344
I did tell Castiel
to get it at any cost.

341
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:24,548
That's my job --
to protect heaven.

342
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,534
I'm a warrior,
just as you are.

343
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:28,486
What would you expect?

344
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:31,238
And now Castiel is
in the wind

345
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,624
with a hydrogen bomb
in his pocket,

346
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:37,962
and I -- I'm scared,
for all of us.

347
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:40,131
Save it.

348
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:44,918
See, I don't trust Angels,
which means I don't trust you.

349
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,471
And yet you haven't warded
this place against us.

350
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:50,441
I know.

351
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:52,776
You're hoping
Castiel will return to you.

352
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:54,562
I admire your loyalty.

353
00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:56,730
I only wish
he felt the same way.

354
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:00,734
I know you don't want to
believe it, Dean,

355
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:04,771
but we're on the same side --
shutting the Gates of Hell,

356
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:07,641
bringing Castiel in
from the cold.

357
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,745
Take a moment.

358
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:13,780
Think about
what I've said.

359
00:23:13,782 --> 00:23:14,965
Oh.

360
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,301
I know you've been
doing business with Ajay.

361
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:19,920
He did mention,
didn't he,

362
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:22,907
that his way into Hell
is through Purgatory?

363
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:27,194
I knew
you'd want to know.

364
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:32,066
You see, we <i>can</i> be of help
to each other.

365
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:37,855
You know
where the hell you're going?

366
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:40,191
Yeah,
we're almost there.

367
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:43,410
Get back.
Get back, get back.

368
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:55,956
Let's go!
We got to get out of here!

369
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,341
Bobby,
they're messing with you.

370
00:23:57,343 --> 00:23:59,593
Don't listen to him.
He's not real.

371
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:01,828
Bobby, get away from him!
We got to go now -- aah!

372
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,333
You knew somehow,
right?

373
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,173
Took a chance.

374
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,843
50/50.

375
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,399
What do we do now?

376
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:21,301
Look, look.

377
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,312
Ajay? Hey.

378
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:49,630
What the hell is this?

379
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:53,550
All right,
don't get all pissed off.

380
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:57,471
Purgatory.

381
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:59,473
Balls!

382
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:02,643
Let's go.

383
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:08,282
Yeah. Hey, it's me.

384
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:09,316
I know.

385
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:12,119
I know, man.
It's been a long time.

386
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:15,122
I mean, I wanted to call. I did.
I just, uh...

387
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:17,074
I thought it might be better
if I didn't.

388
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:19,459
So good to hear your voice,
Dean.

389
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:22,996
I mean that.

390
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:24,631
How you been?

391
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:26,049
Oh, you know...

392
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:29,186
I get by.

393
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:31,088
I guess I let you down,
huh?

394
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,756
Look, I'm, uh...

395
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:35,342
I'm just happy as hell
to hear from you.

396
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:38,679
You might change your mind
about that.

397
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:40,213
Why? What you mean?

398
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:44,084
Benny,
I got to ask you a favor.

399
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,737
It's a big one.

400
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,656
So, how many more
of these trials after this?

401
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:50,824
Just one.

402
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:52,442
Don't know what it is,
though -- not yet.

403
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:54,528
Kevin's
still translating.

404
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,497
Well, you saw back there in
Hell, I ain't got a lot of rust.

405
00:25:57,499 --> 00:26:01,785
Just feels so good
to be back in action again.

406
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:04,288
Might be handy
if you had me around to help.

407
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,841
Bobby, I'd --
I'd love that, believe me.

408
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:11,762
The thing is,
for this trial to be completed,

409
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:13,880
your soul
has to enter Heaven.

410
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:17,083
And besides,
if that weren't the case,

411
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:19,102
we burned your bones,
Bobby.

412
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:21,438
There's nothing to tie
your spirit to earth.

413
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,442
Yeah. Yeah, well...

414
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:28,779
You know, I always figured
that'd be the end of it...

415
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:31,815
You know,
just a Hunter's funeral.

416
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,116
Zip. Nothing.

417
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:35,285
And I was okay with that.

418
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,771
Imagine my surprise.

419
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:41,274
Well, I guess
if there has to be an eternity,

420
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:42,993
I'd pick Heaven over Hell.

421
00:26:42,995 --> 00:26:45,612
Yeah. 'Cause there's nothing
screwy going on up there.

422
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:49,115
I wish I made the rules.

423
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,917
Well...

424
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,256
I'll, uh, do my part,
get to the end of this, but...

425
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:57,891
I ain't exactly
the retiring type,

426
00:26:57,893 --> 00:27:02,145
so, you idjits figure out
a way to spring me...

427
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:05,098
Yeah. No, of course.
That's, uh -- yeah.

428
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,818
Oh, well,
let's get topside.

429
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:12,155
What's going on, Sam?

430
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:14,808
This is it. This is the place.
I'm sure of it.

431
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:19,145
Where your cabbie's
supposed to meet you?

432
00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:21,782
Yeah. At exactly...now.

433
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:23,316
So,
he's running a little late.

434
00:27:23,318 --> 00:27:24,651
No, see,
that's the thing.

435
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:26,820
He was very specific, Bobby,
like, to the minute.

436
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:29,172
And if he doesn't show...?

437
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:31,925
We got no way out.

438
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:39,454
If you want
nothing to do with this,

439
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:41,422
I completely understand.

440
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:44,342
Wow.

441
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:46,511
When Dean Winchester asks for a
favor, he's not screwing around.

442
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:49,047
Benny,
sending you back there

443
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,682
is the last thing
I ever wanted to do.

444
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:52,500
I know. I know.

445
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:54,135
But my little brother
is stuck down there.

446
00:27:54,137 --> 00:27:56,437
This would be the little brother
who wants to kill me, right?

447
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:59,107
You got access
to the place.

448
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,342
By "access,"
you mean "getting beheaded"?

449
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:06,197
Yeah,
you're right -- it's too much.

450
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,533
It's not like I've exactly been
there for you lately.

451
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:10,318
What?

452
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,204
Oh, come on, Dean.

453
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:14,956
You know
I love a challenge.

454
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:19,160
You're serious?

455
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:22,830
Hey,
he's your brother.

456
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:26,300
I say let's do this.

457
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:28,886
I owe you.

458
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,339
Oh,
you don't owe me nothing.

459
00:28:32,674 --> 00:28:34,175
Truth is, uh...

460
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:36,194
I could use a break
from all this.

461
00:28:36,196 --> 00:28:39,514
It really been
that tough?

462
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:42,450
I'm not a good fit,
Dean.

463
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:48,172
Not with vampires and, for sure,
not with the humans.

464
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:50,658
I don't belong.

465
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,010
And after a while...

466
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:56,497
that starts to wear on you.

467
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:01,502
Right?

468
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:05,456
Cry me a river.
Like you need to listen to this.

469
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:09,343
Well,
when you get back up here,

470
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,911
we're gonna fix all that,
okay?

471
00:29:10,913 --> 00:29:13,581
When I get back?

472
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:16,350
Yeah,
you find the portal,

473
00:29:16,352 --> 00:29:18,052
and your ride out of Purgatory
with Sam

474
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:20,688
just like you did with me,
okay?

475
00:29:23,025 --> 00:29:24,442
As soon
as I send you back,

476
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:26,144
I'm gonna haul my ass
up to Maine,

477
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:28,813
and I'm gonna be waiting there
for you when you get topside.

478
00:29:28,815 --> 00:29:32,817
Yeah. That sounds
like a plan, chief.

479
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:36,571
Let's get on with it.

480
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:38,840
You sure about this?

481
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:42,727
Not my first rodeo,
man.

482
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:09,987
Thank you.

483
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:21,866
Well, come on.
You a wimp?

484
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,614
Dean spent a year
in this place?

485
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:39,133
Running and fighting,
all day, every day.

486
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,336
Must have been hell on you
not being able to get him out

487
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:43,604
all that time.

488
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:47,358
You <i>did</i> try?

489
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,644
Look, Bobby, Dean and I
had an agreement, okay?

490
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:51,863
I know that agreement.

491
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:53,847
I taught you
that agreement.

492
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,533
That's a non-agreement.

493
00:30:55,535 --> 00:31:00,188
I get the feeling a lot must
have happened while I was gone.

494
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:04,292
Sam!

495
00:31:15,504 --> 00:31:17,705
Bobby, no, no, wait!
Wait! Wait!

496
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,177
Why are you here?

497
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:26,514
Dean sent me.

498
00:31:26,516 --> 00:31:28,766
Dean? Not my Dean.

499
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,651
He's a buddy of Dean's,
Bobby.

500
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,219
A buddy?

501
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:33,654
A good buddy.

502
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:35,889
A frigging vampire?

503
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:41,061
Well, you two really
went off the rails

504
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:43,080
while I was gone,
didn't you?

505
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:16,263
Hey, Benny, listen -- I know
you saved my brother's ass

506
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:17,931
a few times down here,
and I respect that.

507
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:19,700
Yeah, and now
I'm trying to save yours.

508
00:32:20,787 --> 00:32:22,787
You know, I'm a disgrace
to my own people.

509
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,619
Yeah,
this is the spot.

510
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,326
The seam that gets us
back up top?

511
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:30,872
Mm-hmm.

512
00:32:32,113 --> 00:32:33,598
Is that it?

513
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:36,367
Yeah, that's it.

514
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:38,952
You boys remember
what I told you?

515
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:40,755
Yeah.

516
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:43,290
All right, Bobby,
here it goes.

517
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:45,059
When we get to earth
and I release you,

518
00:32:45,061 --> 00:32:46,727
it's an express
straight to heaven.

519
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:47,745
No time for goodbyes.

520
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:50,231
Already said goodbye
to you once, Sam.

521
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,465
Didn't seem to take.

522
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,601
No reason to think
I won't see you again

523
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,636
somewhere down the road.

524
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:57,605
Yeah.

525
00:32:57,607 --> 00:33:00,658
But if they give me
a rocking chair up there,

526
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,493
I'm raising hell.

<i>unum sumus.</i>

528
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,134
All right. Come on, Benny.
It's your turn.

529
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:31,689
Hurry up.

530
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:33,808
Benny.

531
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,193
And still working
with the Winchesters.

532
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:37,611
Hurry.

533
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,563
Time for you to go,
Sam.

534
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:42,316
Benny?

535
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:46,404
Go on.
It's me they want. Go on.

536
00:33:46,406 --> 00:33:48,489
You just make sure you tell Dean
I said goodbye.

537
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:52,793
I was never any good
up there anyway.

538
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,194
Benny, wait!

539
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:12,179
Benny?

540
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:58,359
Purgatory, right?

541
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,745
A real garden spot,
ain't it?

542
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:03,230
Yeah.

543
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:05,015
Did you get him out?

544
00:35:05,017 --> 00:35:07,718
Only Bobby.

545
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,069
What?

546
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:12,406
I mean,
that's fantastic about Bobby.

547
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:13,908
Dean, look --
Benny, uh...

548
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,044
He got us out.

549
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:20,714
A bunch of vamps showed,
and he used himself as bait.

550
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:26,220
I get the feeling
that even if that didn't happen,

551
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,439
he didn't want to come back,
you know?

552
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm sorry.

553
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:37,114
You're probably right.

554
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:44,822
So, uh...Bobby -- how --
how'd he hold up down there?

555
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:47,908
He's good,
all things considered.

556
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,244
Ornery as hell,
of course.

557
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,295
As he should be.

558
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:55,432
Let's put that old man
where he belongs.

559
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:58,252
Yeah.

563
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:27,681
Hello, boys.

564
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:31,402
Bobby Singer --
I'd know you anywhere.

565
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:34,071
Let him go, Crowley.

566
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:36,490
He doesn't belong
in Hell.

567
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:38,042
He does
if I say he does.

568
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:41,011
He's inflicted untold damage
on my kind.

569
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:44,465
From where I sit, actually,
Hell's too good for him.

570
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,467
Really?

571
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:59,212
What?

572
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:01,565
Oh, come on!

573
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:05,052
Let me see if I've interpreted
the situation correctly.

574
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:08,355
The Winchesters have freed
an innocent from Hell,

to which you are
wrongfully trying to return it.

576
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:14,228
Siding with them, Naomi?
You don't know those two.

577
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,580
Before they're done,
we'll both be locked away.

578
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:19,033
I'm just hoping
they lock <i>you</i> away, dear.

579
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:20,334
The rest I'll figure out.

Bureaucrat.

581
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:24,171

There's always a way.

604

If you can't find one Tran,
find another.

605

Your mom,
she didn't want to give you up.

606
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,158
Quite a pain threshold,
that one.

607
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,728
But even she
could only take so much.

608
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,963
She never would have
told you.

609
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,332
Moms are like that,
aren't they?

610
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,336

is that you are nothing!

617
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:43,927
I buried Benny...

618
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:47,414
...but I didn't burn
his bones.

619
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:50,100
After he said he'd try
to get you out of there,

620
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:51,417
it just didn't seem right.

621
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:54,387
I know you got
no use for him, but --

622
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:56,089
No, no, no.
You know what?

623
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:57,273
I get it.

624
00:40:57,275 --> 00:40:59,926
I do. He's a...

625
00:40:59,928 --> 00:41:02,695
He's a little different
from what I thought.

626
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:06,933
So, go ahead and leave the door
open if you want.

627
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:13,106
All right, well, let's go
check in with Prophet boy

00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:15,175

that tablet.

629
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:20,713
Kevin? It's us.

630

He's gone.

633
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,519
He took all our stuff,
his notes...

634
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:46,656
I saw this coming.
Finally freaked.

635
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:49,559
