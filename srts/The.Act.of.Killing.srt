00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,962
<i>Peace! Happiness! Smile!</i>

3
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,007
<i>1, 234!
Smile! More teeth!</i>

4
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,923
<i>Don't let the camera
catch you looking bad!</i>

5
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,729
<i>Smile! 1, 2, 3, 4!</i>

6
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,049
<i>Real joy, not just pleasure!</i>

7
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,964
<i>And natural beauty!
This isn’t fake!</i>

8
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,166
<i>Okay, peace! Peace! Peace!</i>

9
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,887
I'm looking for an actress...

10
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,924
...an actress to play a mother.

11
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,248
Old ladies like you...

12
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,728
When you see
movie stars on TV-

13
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,686
- you must dream of becoming one.

14
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,089
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

15
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,363
- You have nothing else to do.
- No, I'm busy.

16
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,205
These women won't agree
to play communists like this.

17
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,602
It might work if we
invite them to your house first...

18
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,407
But if we ask them right here,
they'll be afraid.

19
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,002
People might think
they really are communists.

20
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,240
I disagree... In my neighborhood
everybody would do it.

21
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,649
Then let's go there instead.
It's impossible here.

22
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,970
This whole area was communist.

23
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,047
We're looking for
women with children -

24
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,450
-to play communist wives.

25
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,771
You try to prevent us
from burning down your house.

26
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,361
But in the end
we burn it down.

27
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,560
'Mother, they burned
our house down!'

28
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,601
Like that.

29
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,249
And don't worry if you touch
her breasts. You're still a kid.

30
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,602
Ready?

31
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,003
Kill them!

32
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,043
No!

33
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,802
- Destroy their house!
- No, please don't!

34
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,881
Burn it!

35
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,445
Kill!

36
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,521
Cry! Weep!

37
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,644
Don't burn my house.

38
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,529
Keep crying!

39
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,485
Okay cut, cut!

40
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,203
Whether this ends up
on the big screen -

41
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,362
- or only on TV
it doesn't matter.

42
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,646
- But we have to show...
- That this is the history!

43
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,805
This is who we are!

44
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,527
So in the future
people will remember!

45
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,167
It doesn't have to be a big film -

46
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,561
- like Rank Organization,
Paramount Pictures, MGM...

47
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:10,087
We, in our simple way
step by step -

48
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,524
- will tell the story-

49
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,408
- of what we did
when we were young!

50
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,805
Excuse me...

51
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,241
There's many ghosts here, because
many people were killed here.

52
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,684
- They died unnatural deaths.
- Unnatural deaths.

53
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,611
They arrived perfectly healthy.

54
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,771
When they got here
they were beaten up... and died.

55
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,047
At first, we beat them to death...
But there was too much blood.

56
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,723
There was so much blood here...

57
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,688
So when we cleaned it up,
it smelled awful.

58
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,489
To avoid the blood,
I used this system.

59
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,843
Can I show you?

60
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,651
Sit there.

61
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,410
Face that way.

62
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,809
We have to re-enact this properly.

63
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,128
This is how to do it -

64
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,406
- without too much blood.

65
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:56,080
I've tried to forget all this
with good music... Dancing...

66
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,890
Feeling happy..

67
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,801
A little alcohol...

68
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,163
A little marijuana...

69
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,161
A little... what do you call it?
Ecstasy..

70
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,321
Once I'd get drunk,
I'd 'fly' and feel happy.

71
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,330
Cha cha.

72
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,927
He's a happy man.

73
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,641
Anwar Congo,
from the paramilitary group.

74
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,925
You've heard of him?
From the Medan Cinema.

75
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,808
Now that I'm governor,
I stab him if he threatens me.

76
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,244
Everyone was scared of him.

77
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,124
The only one not scared was me-

78
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,120
- because he looked after me
when I was a kid.

79
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,120
When I was in high school -

80
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,563
- I was the only one
not scared of him -

81
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,448
- because I didn't think of him
as a big gangster.

82
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,122
But when people heard his name,
they'd be terrified.

83
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,848
- Why?
- Because he's one of the killers.

84
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,762
Now, the communists' children
are starting to speak out -

85
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,567
- trying to reverse the history.

86
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,288
One of them wrote, 'I’m Proud to be
the Child of a Communist.'

87
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,563
But this won't last long -

88
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,366
- because the people won't accept it.

89
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,167
Communism will never be
accepted here, because -

90
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,050
- we have so many gangsters,
and that's a good thing.

91
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,406
The word 'gangster' comes
from English. 'Free men'.

92
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,650
Thugs want freedom to do things,
even if they're wrong...

93
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,528
But if we know
how to work with them -

94
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,202
- all we have to do is direct them.

95
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,604
We were gangsters.
We didn't have real jobs.

96
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,809
So we'd do anything for money..

97
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,721
...just to buy nice clothes.

98
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,047
This was the cinema -

99
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,050
- where I worked.

100
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,167
I'd stand here,
scalping tickets and showing off.

101
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,842
When films were popular,
we'd scalp tickets.

102
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,650
But when the communists
were strong -

103
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,041
- they demanded
a ban on American films.

104
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,282
They wanted fewer
American films.

105
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,840
- So we gangsters made less money.
- Because there was no audience.

106
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,489
Hollywood films were popular.

107
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,766
Without them the gangsters
didn't make as much money.

108
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,931
As we say:
'Dinner missed the belly'

109
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,291
When we'd watch happy movies,
like Elvis movies -

110
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,681
- we'd leave the cinema smiling,
dancing to the music.

111
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,769
Our hands...

112
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,682
Still dancing...

113
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,804
Still in the mood of the film...

114
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,040
if girls passed,
we'd whistle.

115
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,201
We loved it.
We didn't care what people thought.

116
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,124
Here was the paramilitary office,
where I always killed people.

117
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,928
I'd see the guy
being interrogated...

118
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,411
I'd give him a cigarette.
I'd still be dancing, laughing...

119
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,686
it was like we were killing...

120
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,763
...happily!

121
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,085
When my mom was alive -

122
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,811
- sometimes,
when I was screaming...

123
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,729
...my mom would rush in
and wake me up.

124
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,282
'Before you sleep, wash your feet!'

125
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,247
'Pray properly Don't just sleep.'

126
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:14,120
I know my bad dreams
come from what I did...

127
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,129
...killing people
who didn't want to die.

128
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,402
I forced them to die.

129
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:32,011
<i>Why are you daydreaming,
my love?</i>

130
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,331
<i>Are you so uncertain?</i>

131
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,968
You're a star now!

132
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,243
Amazing!

133
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,408
This guy's a star!

134
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,887
Joshua, film the photos!

135
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,041
That's the president's father-in-law,
Sarwo Edhie.

136
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,450
- I'll introduce them one-by-one.
- That’s the president.

137
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,440
That's him with the president.

138
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,171
Ibrahim Sinik is famous
all across the country!

139
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,641
We gangsters keep him
well protected.

140
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,844
We wish him
a long, prosperous life.

141
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,725
But don't forget
to share your money!

142
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,321
Ask Joshua for money.

143
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,126
After all, he’s from London!

144
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,961
You interrogated communists
in your newsroom?

145
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,210
He was always
gathering information.

146
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,201
When he had the information -

147
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,691
- he'd say: 'Guilty!' and we'd
take them away and kill them.

148
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,768
When you interrogated
communists in your office -

149
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,885
- what questions did you ask?

150
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,647
Whatever we asked,
we'd change their answers -

151
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,605
- to make them look bad.

152
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,644
As a newspaper man -

153
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,882
- my job was to make
the public hate them.

154
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,766
And your relationship
with the army?

155
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,567
- The army.
- We had no formal relationship.

156
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,367
But after we captured
the communist youth -

157
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,882
- and beat them to a pulp -

158
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,482
- we gave them to the army
but the army wouldn't take them.

159
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,287
They said,
'Just dump them in the river.'

160
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,927
Do you remember
exactly what the army said?

161
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,010
I didn't bring the victims.
I had men for that.

162
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,364
Why would I do such grunt work?
Why would I kill people?

163
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,849
I didn't have to! One wink from me
and they're dead!

164
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,771
Pancasila Youth!

165
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,609
How you doing, Anwar?

166
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,329
This is the real Anwar Congo!

167
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,087
<i>Pancasila Youth,
servants of the nation...</i>

168
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,489
<i>Once our sails go up</i> -

169
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,481
- <i>we never turn back!</i>

170
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,247
- Pancasila!
- Forever!

171
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,122
All Pancasila Youth members
are heroes.

172
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,926
From exterminating
the communists -

173
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,001
- to fighting neo-communists
and left-wing extremists-

174
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,163
- and those who want
to destroy our country..

175
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,364
This isn't only the duty
of the army and police.

176
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,122
We, Pancasila Youth,
must take a stand.

177
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:35,885
These are threats to the nation,
and we must take action.

178
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,441
They say Pancasila Youth
is a gangster organization.

179
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,847
If we're gangsters-

180
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,681
- I'm the biggest
gangster of all.

181
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,608
Oh, shit!

182
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,323
How did Pancasila Youth
exterminate the communists?

183
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,602
We killed them all.

184
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,202
That's what happened.

185
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,970
May I hit the ball now?

186
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,120
<i>We have too much democracy
it's chaos.</i>

187
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,563
<i>What is this 'democracy'?</i>

188
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,049
<i>Things were better under
the military dictatorship.</i>

189
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,323
<i>Better economy More security .</i>

190
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,001
<i>Gangsters are free men.</i>

191
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,923
<i>They want to enjoy, life
in their style.</i>

192
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,362
<i>Relax and Rolex.</i>

193
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,290
You definitely have a mole
on your pussy.

194
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,687
Definitely.

195
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,048
That was great.

196
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,363
If I get a strike,
I get a massage!

197
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,689
<i>There must be many ghosts here.</i>

198
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,929
<i>They arrived perfectly healthy.</i>

199
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,851
<i>Then they were beaten up.</i>

200
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,208
<i>And died.</i>

201
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,089
<i>Sit here.</i>

202
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,003
<i>We have to re-enact this properly</i>

203
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,807
I never would have
worn white pants.

204
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,525
I never wore white.

205
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,929
I always wore dark colors.

206
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,851
I look like I'm dressed for a picnic.

207
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,690
My acting has to be violent.

208
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,811
And maybe I should dye
my hair black.

209
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,483
<i>And now he's dead.</i>

210
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,162
But how do you feel
watching this?

211
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,083
How do I feel?
Back then I felt more free.

212
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,005
Older men are gentle,
but young men...

213
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,007
Especially me, because I watched
so many sadistic movies.

214
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,643
We were influenced by them.
So we...

215
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,483
We were more cruel
than the movies.

216
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,165
I know a good location
for a torture scene.

217
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Behind the school,
in the old toilets...

218
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,447
- But the neighbors will hear..
- They know me.

219
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,645
If I look at them,
they run away.

220
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,730
Look, I'm laughing.
I did it wrong, didn't I?

221
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,803
It's my mistake.

222
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,248
<i>I was influenced</i>
by films starring -

223
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,923
- <i>Marlon Brando, Al Pacino...</i>

224
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:27,120
<i>Those were my favorites.
And westerns with John Wayne.</i>

225
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,326
I brought these clothes
from home.

226
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,889
Hopefully they express my vision.

227
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:46,202
Hey you have to change your shirt.
Put on a white one.

228
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,249
You'll look lovely in this!
Perfect!

229
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,123
- What the fuck is this?
- Just a little decoration.

230
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,641
It matches your body shape.

231
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,049
It's perfect!

232
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,644
- This one's for the 'Big Boss'.
- Yep. It's perfect for me.

233
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,482
And you know where I got
the inspiration for it?

234
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,811
I always watched gangsterfilms -

235
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,210
- where they always kill with wire.

236
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,006
It's faster with wire.

237
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,651
Because when you pull the wire
hard, the victim can't grab it...

238
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,482
He can't, because it cuts in...

239
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,326
it's great to be
a communist, huh?

240
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,845
Don't just nod. Say 'Yes sir!'

241
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,043
- Wanna smoke, Pang?
- No.

242
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,089
Try this 'neo-colonialist' cigar.

243
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,204
Have a puff.

244
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,727
Just stick it in your nose
if you don't want to smoke it.

245
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,969
- Look at him!
- Look at me.

246
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,050
Look him in the eye!

247
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,769
Hold on, Joshua.
It's evening prayers.

248
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,367
- Don't tie the blindfold so tight.
- I didn't.

249
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,167
The way I pull it
just looks tight.

250
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,049
Even by the window it's hot.

251
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,010
'Human rights!'

252
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,481
All this talk about 'human rights'
pisses me off.

253
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,481
'We want a little human rights!'

254
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,004
Back then
there was no human rights.

255
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,444
- Because you made a revolution.
- That's no excuse.

256
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,568
For example, in Argentina
some generals launch a coup d'état-

257
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,163
- and then they're convicted
of human rights violations.

258
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,727
But I'm a gangster

259
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,563
I'm a gangster A free man.

260
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,127
A movietheater gangster.

261
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,891
Not much education.

262
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,802
- A human drop out.
- A drop out.

263
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,404
There are people like me
everywhere in the world.

264
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,646
They still look great.

265
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,763
There were many
Chinese communists!

266
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,171
I got a thick book
with all their names.

267
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,001
I'd visit them,
'How much you gonna pay?'

268
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,411
They'd say
'Please, Sir don't! I'm old.'

269
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,050
We used them for their money
We didn't kill them.

270
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,644
But if they didn't pay we killed
them. They can't have it both ways.

271
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,322
If they didn't pay..

272
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,171
...we killed them.

273
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,091
These Chinese are diff cult.
Sometimes they piss me off.

274
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:25,525
That's it...
You sure speak good Chinese.

275
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,531
When I need money
there's nothing like an old friend.

276
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,487
With others, if it's not enough,
I won't accept it.

277
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,364
Hi Lung. C'mon, shake my hand.
It's been a long time.

278
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,690
- I need money.
- Why me?

279
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,044
I'm asking you nicely

280
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,087
I don't even ask the others.
I just punch them...

281
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,489
An uppercut right in the stomach.

282
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,650
You give this sincerely?
Then thank you very much.

283
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,602
Our organization is planning
a big meeting. We need money.

284
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,600
We need more than normal.

285
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,249
We need a huge amount.

286
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,922
Don't give the usual amount.

287
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,846
What’s this shit?

288
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,361
Give more
or I won't accept it.

289
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,646
- Please...
- I'd never accept so little.

290
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,088
Here.

291
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,329
That's not enough.

292
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,285
What's wrong with you, Cik?

293
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,882
We consider you our father Cik.

294
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,723
So throw in more, and we'll take it,
because this isn’t for just anybody.

295
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,130
Count it up and put it in.

296
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,526
The spirit of Pancasila Youth -

297
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,884
- which people accuse
of being gangsters...

298
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,802
Gangsters are people
who work outside the system -

299
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,085
- not for the government.

300
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,281
The word 'gangster'
comes from 'free men'.

301
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,530
This nation needs 'free men'!

302
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,403
If everyone worked for
the government-

303
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,844
- we'd be a nation of bureaucrats.
We'd get nothing done.

304
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,408
We need gangsters
to get things done.

305
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,207
Free, private men
who get things done.

306
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,362
Use your muscles!

307
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,689
Muscles aren't
for beating people up -

308
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,046
- although beating people up
is sometimes needed.

309
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,963
- Once more, Pancasila!
- Forever!

310
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,766
- Pancasila!
- Freedom!

311
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,841
<i>While you wait for this train,
we wish to inform you -</i>

312
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,843
<i>- that the traffic laws are there
to protect you and your family.</i>

313
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,602
<i>We also inform you,
that in accordance with the law...</i>

314
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,441
- This is me, Anwar Congo.
- Oh, that's you!

315
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,484
Look, I'm rolling a joint.

316
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,809
You're smoking pot.

317
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,246
That's me. I'm wearing a plaid shirt,
camouflage pants, saddle shoes...

318
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,171
See how 'elite' I am?

319
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,967
This is what you should wear
in the studio scene.

320
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:26,691
And for the killing scene... Jeans.
I wore jeans for killing.

321
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,081
When you kill people, you should
wear thick pants. Like this...

322
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,605
- How about a checkered pattern?
- That'd be great, but small ones.

323
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,648
To look cool,
I imitated movie stars.

324
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,209
But I didn't copy Elvis Presley

325
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,611
Herman, I'll make you
a gorgeous dress!

326
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,809
- More energy!
- We're ready boss!

327
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,129
Burn them all!

328
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,084
Finally you got it!

329
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,482
Cry 'What's going on, mom?'
'Leave us alone!'

330
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,323
Wait everybody!
Anwar show us how to kill.

331
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,928
You! Come here!

332
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,885
What's going on?

333
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:38,680
Who says I'm a communist?

334
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,091
Hold him down!

335
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,641
Torture him! Kill him!

336
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,769
Are you listening?

337
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,090
Stop denying
you're a communist!

338
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,091
- Okay fine!
- Leave our grandfather alone!

339
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,330
You take him, I'll take the kids!

340
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,803
- You love these kids?
- Please stop.

341
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,401
Sit!

342
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,083
- Or I'll smash this kid!
- Let me go!

343
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,128
If you love these kids,
you better stop lying.

344
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,846
It's your choice!

345
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,527
Cut!

346
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,441
Amazing!

347
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,131
Why do people watch James Bond?

348
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,441
To see action.

349
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,884
Why do people watch films about
Nazis? To see power and sadism!

350
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,287
We can do that!

351
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,964
We can make something
even more sadistic than...

352
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,565
...more sadistic than what
you see in movies about Nazis.

353
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,922
Sure I can!

354
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,286
Because there's never been a movie
where heads get chopped off-

355
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,565
- except in fiction,
but that’s different -

356
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,765
- because I did it in real life!

357
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,646
<i>What's clear is no film
has ever used our method.</i>

358
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,809
<i>We can attract a huge audience!</i>

359
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,005
<i>Humor... it's a must.</i>

360
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,647
<i>- Romance?
- We've got it!</i>

361
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,246
Fuck this umbrella!

362
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,444
Herman’s trapped.

363
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,281
He should scream,
'Leave me alone! Stop! Stop!'

364
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,441
Meanwhile, the three of us scream,
'You communist bitch!'

365
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,682
Keep attacking her!

366
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,526
I'm gonna rape you!
I'm gonna kill you!

367
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,648
How long have you been pregnant?
You'll give birth to a communist!

368
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,889
But if the audience is
tense the whole time -

369
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,323
- with nothing to entertain them,
it will never work!

370
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,766
On Saturday night,
I went to the movies.

371
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,490
Oh, I'm not gonna
shake my ass or anything.

372
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,529
I watched the movie
alone with my girlfriend.

373
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:22,720
<i>The film was sold out</i> -

374
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,690
- so I bought tickets from
the movie theater gangsters.

375
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,327
<i>Oh how lovely..</i>

376
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,651
- Adi! How’s the family?
- We're all fine.

377
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,008
Was it a good flight?

378
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,410
- How've you been, Anwar?
- I'm fine.

379
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,162
- The city has changed a lot.
- Really?

380
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,729
I've tried to call you many times.

381
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,084
But you never answer my calls.

382
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,047
Your nose needs more.

383
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,089
- Do you remember Soaduon?
- Yes, where is he?

384
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,161
Over there. Soaduon Siregar.

385
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:14,163
Now he takes credit for everything,
but back then he was nobody

386
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,842
I remember him.

387
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,164
- Adi, this is Soaduon Siregar.
- I remember you.

388
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,570
He's one of Ibrahim's Sinik's
journalists.

389
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,081
As they say:

390
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,241
'Although camels live in Arabia,
they never get to visit Mecca.'

391
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,889
Being close to a rich boss
didn't make him rich.

392
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,005
Just like me.
Have a seat.

393
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,921
Interrogation of Communist, Take 2

394
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,003
We give land to the farmers.

395
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,161
We give them fertilizer, seeds,
farming equipment...

396
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,445
In order to spread
communism, right?

397
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:23,161
Indeed, we want to show that
the Communists are the best party.

398
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,401
Why do you recruit people
to join an illegal party?

399
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,925
But back then, it wasn't illegal.

400
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,728
- It wasn't?
- Before 1965? Of course not!

401
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:48,362
It's easy to make the communists
look bad after we destroyed them.

402
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,001
So, the communists were not
more cruel than us.

403
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,569
We were the cruel ones!

404
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,606
'Cruel' is totally
different from sadistic.

405
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,522
- No, it isn't. They're synonyms.
- No.

406
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,291
Sadism is different.

407
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,768
- You're playing with words!
- No, I'm not.

408
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,201
You're playing with words.

409
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,523
It bumped its head.

410
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,565
Sometimes I think... if my dad
was a communist and was killed -

411
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,084
- I'd be upset. That's normal, right?

412
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,602
For example, if you killed my father
I'd be upset with you.

413
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,087
Why'd you kill my father?

414
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,127
Then, you don't let me go to school.
You don't let me work.

415
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,565
You don't even let me marry
This needs to be changed.

416
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,764
There's been no official apology -

417
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,567
- but what's so hard
about apologizing?

418
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,560
The government would apologize,
not us.

419
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,890
It would be like medicine.
It would reduce the pain.

420
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,246
- Forgiveness.
- Wouldn't they curse us secretly?

421
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:31,210
They curse us secretly..
Because if they cursed us openly..

422
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,566
They'd be arrested!
So they whisper their curses?

423
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,250
For me, Adi, in the end...

424
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,566
I'm disturbed in my sleep.
Maybe because-

425
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,244
- when I strangled people with wire
I watched them die...

426
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,570
But when you used other methods,
you also watched.

427
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,685
Yes, but when I'm falling asleep,
it comes back to me.

428
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,611
That's what gives me nightmares.

429
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,286
You feel haunted
because your mind is weak.

430
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,882
Have you ever been
to a neurologist?

431
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:23,008
If I went to a neurologist,
it would mean I'm crazy.

432
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,127
No! Psychiatrists are not
for crazy people.

433
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:34,885
Psychiatrists aren't for crazy
people. They're nerve experts.

434
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:42,089
Even I've been to a nerve expert...
But for a mild stroke.

435
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:49,883
See, your nightmares are just
a nerve disturbance.

436
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,050
Come on, give it a try!

437
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:59,327
If you see a shrink,
you talk, he talks.

438
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,007
Then he gives you nerve vitamins.

439
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,042
Remember the 'Crush
the Chinese' campaign in 1966?

440
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,561
All along Sudirman Street -

441
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,288
- I killed every Chinese
person I met. I stabbed them!

442
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:32,967
I don't remember how many
but it was dozens.

443
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,687
If I met them, I stabbed them.

444
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,807
All the way to Asia Street,
where I met my girlfriend's dad.

445
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,483
Remember my girlfriend
was Chinese?

446
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,242
'Crush the Chinese' became
'Crush my Girlfriend's Dad'!

447
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,240
So I stabbed him, too!
Because he was Chinese!

448
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,446
He fell into a ditch.
I hit him with a brick. He sank.

449
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:12,166
Killing is the worst crime
you can do.

450
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,807
So the key is to find a way -

451
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,324
- not to feel guilty

452
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,888
it's all about finding
the right excuse.

453
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:29,962
For example, if I'm asked
to kill someone...

454
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:38,044
If the compensation is right...

455
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,491
...then of course I'll do it, and
from one perspective it's not wrong.

456
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,208
That’s the perspective
we must make ourselves believe.

457
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,922
At first, I was scared...
These are top gangsters!

458
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,287
Like you and Anwar...

459
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,486
Terrifying!
And making a film! It's shocking!

460
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,127
But if you want a true story
I have one.

461
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,611
Tell us. Because everything
in this film should be true.

462
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,601
There was a shopkeeper.

463
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,203
He was the only Chinese person
in the area.

464
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,564
To be honest,
he was my stepfather.

465
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,809
He was my stepfather..

466
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,766
But although
he was my stepfather-

467
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,045
- I lived with him
since I was a baby..

468
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:48,361
At 3 AM,
someone knocked on our door.

469
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:55,125
They called my dad. Mom said,
'It's dangerous! Don't go out.'

470
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,926
But he went out.

471
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,442
We heard him shout, 'Help!'
Then, silence.

472
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:06,168
They took him away
We couldn't sleep until morning.

473
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,763
- How old were you?
- 11 or 12...

474
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,725
I remember it well.

475
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,447
And it's impossible to forget!

476
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,168
We found his body
under an oil drum.

477
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:27,241
The drum was cut in half-

478
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,842
- and the body was under it,
like this...

479
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,283
His head and feet were
covered by sacks -

480
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,484
- but one foot poked out like this.

481
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,685
That same morning,
nobody dared help us...

482
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:49,287
We buried him like a goat
next to the main road.

483
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,849
Just me and my grandfather
carrying the body-

484
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,967
- digging the grave... No one
helped us. I was so small.

485
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:07,320
Then, all the communist families
were exiled...

486
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,962
We were dumped in a shantytown
at the edge of the jungle.

487
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,848
That's why to be honest,
I've never been to school.

488
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,931
I had to teach myself
to read and write.

489
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,523
Why should I hide this from you?

490
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,921
I promise I'm not
criticizing what we're doing.

491
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,365
It's only input for the film.
I promise I'm not criticizing you.

492
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,928
Look, everything's
already been planned.

493
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,806
We can't include every story
or the film will never end.

494
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,009
And your story is too complicated.
It would take days to shoot.

495
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,764
- Maybe we can work it in...
- Or it can motivate the actors.

496
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,049
We believe this man's a communist.

497
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,924
After we decided to kill him, there
were many reactions. Some prayed.

498
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,524
- Come on, pray.
- 'God help me!'

499
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,441
How do you tell him he's going
to die? Angrily or softly?

500
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:28,842
I tried to make them accept
that they were going to die.

501
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,409
Anwar teach us how to torture.

502
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,844
'You want me to use this?'

503
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,329
- Should I scare him?
- Yes.

504
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,162
You want me to use this?

505
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,844
Then, beg him not to.

506
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,400
Now, take the cloth
and blindfold him.

507
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:06,165
Josh always asks me,
'You worked in the same office -

508
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,285
- how could you not have known?'

509
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,567
I declare: I never saw anything.

510
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,927
Now, seeing your re-enactment,
I realize you were so smooth -

511
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,604
- that even me, a journalist
with such sharp senses...

512
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,802
I never knew!

513
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm surprised. Because we didn't
hide what we were doing.

514
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,921
- If you didn't know, I'd be shocked.
- I didn't.

515
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,805
We were in the same office...

516
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,927
- And we didn't hide it.
- I never knew.

517
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:04,082
You were so smooth, and I rarely
went upstairs to your office.

518
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:10,162
- Your publisher directed the torture.
- No!

519
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,682
- He says so himself.
- That's not true!

520
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:21,048
He and the other leaders
decided who we killed.

521
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,482
Look, I'm not calling you a liar,
but logically..

522
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,846
- Continue, Adi.
- I'm not calling him a liar Joshua.

523
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:40,040
But this man, a journalist distancing
himself from these things...

524
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:46,601
That's predictable. But logically
something we didn't hide...

525
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:52,170
How could he not know?
Even the neighbors knew!

526
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:57,890
Hundreds were killed.
It was an open secret.

527
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:04,689
- Drink!
- Have some water.

528
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,090
- Drink!
- It's not poison!

529
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,127
Drink! Just drink it.

530
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:21,169
- Drink it. It will refresh you.
- Give him a cigarette.

531
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,003
Let him smoke.

532
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,330
It's sadistic, Adi.

533
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,209
Ask him again about his activities.

534
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,487
Have mercy on me.

535
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,045
Please, sir.

536
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,249
Should we kill him?

537
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,651
Wait. Would you give a
message to my family?

538
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,287
Sure.

539
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:22,125
Or could I speak to them
one last time?

540
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,767
No way.

541
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,726
Okay pull.

542
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:44,527
Lower your head.

543
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,041
He's dead.

544
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,810
Wrap him up.

545
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,086
Listen, if we succeed
in making this film -

546
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,571
- it will disprove all the propaganda
about the communists being cruel.

547
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,321
- And show that we were cruel!
- We're the cruel ones.

548
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:36,051
If this film is a success! We must
understand every step we take here.

549
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,404
It's not about fear
it's 40 years ago...

550
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,525
...so any criminal case has expired.

551
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,647
It's not about fear it's about
image. The whole society will say:

552
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:56,610
'We always suspected it. They lied
about the communists being cruel.'

553
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,089
it's not a problem for us.
It's a problem for history.

554
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:09,006
The whole story will be reversed.
Not 180 degrees... 360 degrees!

555
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,363
If we succeed with this scene!

556
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:20,560
But why should we always hide
our history if that's the truth?

557
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,923
No, the consequence is...

558
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,125
...that everything Anwar
and I have always said is false.

559
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,971
It's not the communists
who were cruel.

560
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,210
- But that’s true!
- I completely agree.

561
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,966
But not everything true
should be made public.

562
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,687
I believe even God has secrets.

563
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,045
I'm absolutely aware
that we were cruel.

564
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,846
That's all I have to say

565
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,568
it's up to you what to do about it.

566
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:43,807
I don't mean to make you
uncomfortable, but I have to ask...

567
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,086
By telling yourself it was 'war',
you're not haunted like Anwar.

568
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,888
But the Geneva Conventions
define what you did as 'war crimes'.

569
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:58,369
I don't necessarily agree
with those international laws.

570
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:03,407
When Bush was in power
Guantanamo was right.

571
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:09,084
Saddam Hussein had
weapons of mass destruction.

572
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:16,050
That was right according to Bush,
but now it's wrong.

573
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,046
The Geneva Conventions may be
today's morality but tomorrow -

574
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,689
- we'll have the Jakarta Conventions
and dump the Geneva Conventions.

575
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,721
'War crimes' are defined
by the winners.

576
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,811
I'm a winner So I can make
my own definition.

577
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,402
I needn't follow
the international definitions.

578
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:46,801
And more important,
not everything true is good.

579
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,484
Some truths are not good.
Like re-opening this case.

580
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:56,446
Even if everything you're finding out
is true, it's not good.

581
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,851
But for millions of victims'
families-

582
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,126
- if the truth comes out, it's good.

583
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:12,724
Fine, but start with the first
murder Cain and Abel.

584
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,289
Why focus on killing
the communists?

585
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,051
Americans killed the Indians.

586
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,086
Has anybody been
punished for that? Punish them!

587
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,410
For me, re-opening this case
is a provocation to fight.

588
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,003
I'm ready! If the world wants
continuous war, I'm ready

589
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,205
if you wanna make
us fight, I'm ready!

590
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,965
What if you were brought to the
international court in the Hague?

591
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,130
- Now?
- Yes.

592
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,850
I'd go! I don't feel guilty
so why would I go?

593
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:57,807
Because I'd be famous.
I'm ready!

594
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,530
Please, get me called
to the Hague!

595
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,531
More hot!

596
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,691
More hot!

597
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,286
I like this... Eye candy.

598
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,689
This is healthy for a guy like me.

599
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,166
Enjoy the scenery Ma'am.
Okay.

600
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,887
- One, two, three.
- Ah!

601
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,845
- Again! One, two, three.
- Ah!

602
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,522
<i>I was asked to run for parliament.</i>

603
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,044
<i>'Why me?' 'Don't worry!
You can do it!' they said.</i>

604
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:13,169
<i>Then I thought,
'Why not?'.</i>

605
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:18,890
<i>In fact, I'm a perfect candidate
because I'm well known!</i>

606
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,644
Don't clench your fist.

607
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,366
Be quiet!
I've almost got it!

608
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,087
- OK, but don't make a fist.
- You're ruining the sound!

609
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,124
- But...
- Stop it!

610
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:52,451
Be quiet!
You're a real pain! Just shut up!

611
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,043
Long live the Businessmen and
Workers Party! I am Herman...

612
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,962
...ready to fight
for workers' rights.

613
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,165
Remember to vote
for me on election day!

614
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,922
<i>If I get elected and get
on the Building Commission -</i>

615
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:19,604
<i>- I can get money from everyone.</i>

616
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,407
<i>For example, if a building
is 10 cm too small...</i>

617
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,162
<i>I can demand
'Tear down the building!'.</i>

618
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,524
<i>They'll say, 'Please don't report us.
Here's your money'.</i>

619
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,889
<i>Even if nothing's
wrong with the building -</i>

620
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,170
<i>- if I threaten them,
they'll give me money anyway.</i>

621
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,841
<i>Not just a little money
In a block of 10 buildings...</i>

622
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,567
<i>if each pays $10000,
just do the math!</i>

623
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,162
That's already $100,000.

624
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,521
That's only one neighborhood!

625
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:11,290
Actually parliament should
bethe most noble place in society.

626
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,723
But if we see
what they do there...

627
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:22,771
They're really just
robbers with ties.

628
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,767
What illegal businesses are
Pancasila Youth involved in?

629
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,964
Gambling.

630
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,210
Gambling, night clubs.

631
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,641
Supermarkets.

632
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:44,243
But that’s not illegal.
They just hire us as security.

633
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,126
- The illegal ones?
- Gambling.

634
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,051
- Any others?
- Smuggling.

635
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:57,486
Illegal fishing, illegal logging,
illegal gambling...

636
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,651
...and if they don't pay
we blackmail them.

637
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,126
Let's welcome our candidate,
Marzuki!

638
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,449
Long live our party!

639
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,369
Pancasila!

640
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,002
Ready!

641
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,000
What am I supposed to say?
How does it begin?

642
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,205
- What's the first sentence?
- I'm Herman.

643
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,483
- I'm Herman!
- Stand up, you'll look better.

644
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,003
Ladies and gentlemen... What
comes next? I can't remember

645
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:38,482
I'm Herman, from the Businessmen
and Workers' Party!

646
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:48,441
- Any free T-shirts?
- Nope... Ma'am, here's my card.

647
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,120
T-shirts! We want presents!

648
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,326
Don't worry about money or presents.
We'll come back with gifts.

649
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,524
Pray for us, hopefully he'll win.

650
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,451
Tell people
who ask for presents...

651
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,769
'We'll come back with gifts
if we win.'

652
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,726
Tell them, 'We're filming today'

653
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,247
- Don't forget.
- Just a card?

654
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,522
Where's 'the bonus'?
Don't we get anything else?

655
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,684
- 'The bonus' comes later.
- Once you're elected?

656
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,171
- Honey where do you think you are?
- Yes, but...

657
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,122
<i>Many of the parties
bribe people to vote for them.</i>

658
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,369
<i>In fact, they all do.</i>

659
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,690
<i>And when you see thousands
of people at a rally -</i>

660
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,930
<i>- all of them
were paid to be there.</i>

661
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,684
<i>They consider it going to work.</i>

662
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,322
<i>Without money they won't come.</i>

663
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,605
<i>They'll ask each other,
'how much did you get?'.</i>

664
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:08,408
<i>And leaders just get paid more!</i>

665
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:21,768
<i>Nowadays, nobody believes
in what they're campaigning for.</i>

666
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,446
<i>We've all become
like soap opera actors.</i>

667
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,326
<i>Our souls have become
like soap opera actors.</i>

668
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,081
<i>They look happy,
but inside they’re pissed off!</i>

669
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,046
<i>Fuck this shit, they're thinking.</i>

670
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,080
Where's the injured one?

671
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,769
Where’s the crippled one?

672
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,043
- Which?
- The injured one.

673
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,642
There she is.

674
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,131
- Sweet little duck.
- Don't! You'll hurt her again.

675
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,245
She's weak
because you broke her leg.

676
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:47,128
Don't do that.
She's a baby!

677
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:51,801
Say 'I’m sorry Duck.'

678
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,207
- I'm sorry Duck.
- That's it.

679
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,928
Now say 'lt was an accident.
I was scared, so I hit you.'

680
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,329
Say 'lt was an accident.'
Speak loudly.

681
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,287
- Sorry Duck.
- And pet her a little.

682
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,642
Now the communist
has become a ghost.

683
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:27,804
He was killed and became a ghost.

684
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,685
- Haunting you.
- Haunting me.

685
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,208
Do you feel trauma seeing this?

686
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:40,886
If he came to me at night,
I'd be terrified.

687
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:45,927
It's like the ghosts hate me.

688
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,170
Because in my dreams they
have threatening voices...

689
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:56,163
- They laugh, but frighteningly!
- Try to laugh.

690
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,081
Anwar's nightmare, take 2.

691
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,121
Standby.

692
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,526
Record.

693
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:24,404
I thought I killed you!

694
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,162
- What did I do wrong?
- Just get up, surprised.

695
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:38,641
And ask, 'Why are you alive?'
What's so hard about it?

696
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,691
I... I thought I killed you!

697
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,443
Why am I coming to this place?

698
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:27,045
Because it affected me so deeply.

699
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,771
Because the method of killing...

700
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,288
...was very different.

701
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:46,284
And that's why I always
have nightmares.

702
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,480
Is it because I've been
telling you my story so honestly?

703
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:06,568
Or maybe
the vengeance of the dead?

704
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:15,403
<i>I remember... I said
'Get out of the car'.</i>

705
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,400
<i>He asked,
'Where are you taking me?'.</i>

706
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:24,931
<i>Soon, he refused to keep walking...</i>

707
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,887
<i>I saw Roshiman bringing me
a machete.</i>

708
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:40,481
Spontaneously I walked over to him
and cut his head off.

709
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:46,687
My friends didn't want to look.

710
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,044
They ran back to the car.

711
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,162
And I heard this sound...

712
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,610
His body had fallen down...

713
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,089
And the eyes in his head
were still...

714
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,401
</i>On the way home, I kept thinking,
why didn't I close his eyes?</i>

715
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:31,891
</i>All I could think about was
why didn't I close his eyes?</i>

716
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,883
And that is the source
of all my nightmares...

717
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:44,531
I'm always gazed at by those
eyes that I didn't close.

718
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:50,966
That's what always
disturbs me so very much.

719
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,890
Slit his throat!

720
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,801
Cut off his head!

721
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,606
Hooray!

722
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,050
Did you take it?
Is it good?

723
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,083
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, Sir.

724
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:44,490
No. With such a beautiful girl?
I should thank you.

725
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,321
Too bad she bleaches her hair...
Makes her look like a whore.

726
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,891
- Tell him about the car!
- What happened?

727
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,686
There was this girl...

728
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,962
She sucked off six men -

729
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,731
- and not a drop of cum on the floor.

730
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,890
- Six men?
- She swallowed it all.

731
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:15,085
And after the last guy finishes,
she's still sucking -

732
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,444
- like she wanted more!

733
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:34,280
Dear God, make our great
organization a pillar of this nation.

734
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:42,410
You know the price of the land?
200 million dollars.

735
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,610
I gave it to the birds.

736
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,690
So they have a happy life.
I'm also happy.

737
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,362
Everybody's terrified of
the paramilitaries.

738
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:04,201
So, when a businessman wants
land where people are living...

739
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,086
if he just pays for it,
it's expensive.

740
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:13,889
But we can solve his problem.

741
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,245
Because people are terrified of us,
when we show up -

742
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:24,923
- they say 'Just take the land.
Pay what you like.'

743
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,369
This is a rose.

744
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,166
Very very limited.

745
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,405
Elephant.
This is very very limited.

746
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,885
I buy these
from every country I visit.

747
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,562
Hungary
2,250 dollars.

748
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,045
You've cut off my head...

749
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:37,644
You have to be furious,
but also sad.

750
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,880
You have to be angry sad.
Sadistic.

751
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,084
Look at your blood!

752
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,680
Look what I found
in your stomach!

753
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,211
Look at this!
Your liver.

754
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,846
It's rotten!

755
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:10,362
Even in make-up he looks like
he's from Ethiopia!

756
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:16,408
- Tanzania. Like Idi Amin.
- Idi Amin Dada.

757
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:27,401
Camera 3 on Citra!
Close up on Citra for the opening.

758
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,730
Everybody ready?
Roll the leader!

759
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:40,443
Indonesian National Television
'Special Dialogue'

760
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:45,328
Welcome back to Indonesian
Television's Special Dialogue.

761
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,161
Today we meet movie theater
gangsters who are making a film -

762
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,488
-to commemorate the
crushing of the communists.

763
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:55,571
We go straight to the perpetrator
and star of the film, Anwar Congo!

764
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,082
Let's welcome Anwar Congo!

765
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,205
In those days movie theater
gangsters were very well known.

766
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,802
What's the origin of
the word 'gangster'?

767
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,085
Actually gangster comes
from 'free men'.

768
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:17,446
That's why we use
a special song in our movie.

769
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:23,329
A song called 'Born Free.'

770
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,127
So you brought the communists
straight to your office?

771
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:34,841
Yes, and after we interrogated them,
and decided they shouldn't be alive-

772
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,250
- we had to kill them.

773
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,809
And was your method of killing
inspired by gangsterfilms?

774
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,207
Sometimes!

775
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,164
It's like...

776
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,569
Amazing!
He was inspired by films!

777
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:57,244
Each genre had its own method.
Like in mafia movies...

778
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:03,891
...they strangle the guy in
the car and dump the body.

779
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,242
So we did that too.

780
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:10,525
Which means Anwar
and his friends developed -

781
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,645
- a new, more efficient system
for exterminating communists.

782
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:20,210
It was more humane, less sadistic,
and avoided excessive violence...

783
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,724
But you also just wiped them out!

784
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:34,411
- How many people did he kill?
- About 1000.

785
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:38,730
How can he sleep?
Isn't he haunted?

786
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,163
- A lot of them went crazy.
- Yeah.

787
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,603
- No, they got rich.
- Yeah.

788
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,521
Rich from stealing.

789
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:54,487
But killing all those people
made them crazy too.

790
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:01,169
But what’s the special meaning
of this film for young people?

791
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:07,242
Young people must remember
their history.

792
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,240
They must never forget.
What's more...

793
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,125
God must be against communists.

794
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,766
Yes. God hates communists!

795
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,282
That's why he's made
this film so beautiful!

796
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:26,647
According to General Sarwo Edhie
2.5 million communists were killed.

797
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:32,165
Why haven’t the victims'
children ever tried to take revenge?

798
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:39,170
It's not that they don't want
to take revenge. They can't!

799
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:43,490
Because we'd exterminate them all!

800
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:05,125
This is the only film shoot to be
visited by a government minister.

801
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:12,408
He's coming here just for you,
to motivate and support you!

802
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,126
You should be proud!

803
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,327
The whole world will see this.
London, England!

804
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,410
Forget Jakarta.
Jakarta is nothing!

805
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,930
Wow! All the killers are here!

806
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:48,080
Just improvise
and express your anger.

807
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,408
Scream, 'Crush the communists!'

808
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:55,891
- Crush the communists!
- Wipe them out!

809
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,606
Okay let’s try it.

810
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,645
Attack on Kampung Kolam. Take 1.

811
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,811
Don't let any communists escape!

812
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,249
Kill! Kill!
Kill the communists!

813
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:19,728
Slaughterthem!

814
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,366
Are you ready to attack?

815
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:28,488
Take no prisoners!
Destroy them all!

816
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,403
Burn down their houses!

817
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:39,767
Kill the communists!
Chop them up!

818
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,682
Exterminate them to their roots!

819
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:53,362
Chop off their heads
Burn them! Kill them all!

820
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:57,326
Kill! Kill!

821
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:09,131
Cut! Cut! Cut!

822
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:16,363
Joshua and crew, now I'm speaking
as a leader of Pancasila Youth.

823
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:23,091
What we’ve just shown is not
characteristic of our organization.

824
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:28,280
We shouldn't look brutal,
like we want to drink people's blood.

825
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:40,763
That's dangerous
for our organization's image.

826
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,443
But we must exterminate
the communists.

827
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,450
We must totally
wipe them out-

828
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:53,601
- but in a more humane way.

829
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:58,567
What we just filmed,
I felt awful...

830
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,570
Especially with my image
right in the middle of it!

831
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,161
OK, Joshua?

832
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:08,809
This is the true story
That's what we all want, right?

833
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,685
Sure. Sure.

834
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,121
You know, what we just filmed...

835
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:19,690
Don't erase it! Use it to show
how ferocious we can be!

836
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:25,250
In fact, we can even be worse!

837
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:31,686
So, think of it as
a simulation of our rage -

838
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:36,727
- if anyone disturbs our country

839
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:47,122
If they're pretty I'd rape them all.

840
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:54,283
Especially back then,
when we were the law.

841
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,891
Fuck 'em!

842
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,846
Fuck the shit
out of everyone I meet.

843
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:04,728
Are you a communist woman?

844
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,527
What are you hiding there?

845
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,371
That’s the spirit!

846
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:16,521
Especially if you get one
who's only 14 years old.

847
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:18,290
Delicious!

848
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:24,567
I'd say it's gonna be hell for you
but heaven on earth for me.

849
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,445
Keep struggling.

850
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,450
No one wants to be tortured, right?

851
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,610
If you can save yourself,
you should.

852
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:38,124
And if you can
run away go ahead!

853
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,448
Attention everybody!

854
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,326
While you're acting,
remember the cameras!

855
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,200
Ladies, think positively

856
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,244
if you think positively -

857
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:59,322
- your acting will be great
and the scene will succeed.

858
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,568
Positive! Think positive!

859
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,445
Kill them all!

860
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:48,481
Catch him!

861
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,649
Cut! Cut! Cut!

862
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,764
Bakti! Bring water!

863
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,485
Let her rest.

864
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:46,927
Febby your acting was great.
But stop crying.

865
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:54,725
You're embarassing me.
Film stars only cry for a moment.

866
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,840
What I regret... Honestly I never
expected it would look this awful.

867
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:19,440
My friends kept telling me
to act more sadistic -

868
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:25,124
- but then I saw
the women and children.

869
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:30,443
Imagine those children's future.

870
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,007
They've been tortured...

871
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,283
Now their houses
will be burned down...

872
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:40,201
What future do they have?

873
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:46,201
They will curse us
for the rest of their lives.

874
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,927
This was so very very very..

875
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,731
When you say 'karma'...

876
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:01,448
What does it mean for you?
What are you afraid of?

877
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:10,920
Karma is like a law of nature.

878
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,522
A law straight from God.

879
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,369
Imagine, in all this darkness -

880
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:36,364
- it's like we're living
at the end of the world.

881
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:41,963
We look around...
There's only darkness.

882
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:48,962
It's so very terrifying.

883
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:22,883
Hit the table.
To frighten me.

884
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:27,244
Start by hitting the table. Hard.

885
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,850
Trying to ban American films
in Indonesia?

886
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:49,249
What are you trying to do?

887
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,003
Shut up!

888
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:57,285
- What are you trying to do?
- Please, sir..

889
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,963
Don't get friendly with me!
We're not friends!

890
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,367
Answer the questions!

891
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,521
Hurry up
or I'll break your legs!

892
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:13,042
Dana, ask!

893
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:17,245
Besides Titi Kuning,
where else are you active?

894
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:21,809
- Hamparan Perak.
- A real big communist.

895
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,565
Quick! Don't waste our time!

896
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:31,808
Lift up your hand
or I'll cut it off.

897
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,324
Hey look! Gold!

898
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:40,889
Take off your watch.

899
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:45,290
Put it on the table.
What else do you have?

900
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:48,927
A ring? Gold?

901
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:53,045
Talk or I cut your face.

902
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:57,211
- Talk.
- Tell us everything!

903
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:02,930
- Please, don't...
- I won't, but you talk!

904
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:06,169
Talk...

905
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,407
Cut.

906
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:28,291
Okay let's do it.

907
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:49,440
I place this medal
around your neck.

908
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:40,329
- Are you alright?
- I can't do that again.

909
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,731
Get him some water.

910
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:15,645
Have some water.

911
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:59,764
<i>We shoved wood in their anus
until they died.</i>

912
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,925
<i>We crushed their necks
with wood. We hung them.</i>

913
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:09,842
<i>We strangled them with wire.
We cut off their heads.</i>

914
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:13,010
<i>We ran them over with cars.</i>

915
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,922
<i>We were allowed to do it.</i>

916
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:24,246
<i>And the proof is, we murdered
people and were never punished.</i>

917
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:34,160
<i>The people we killed... There's
nothing to be done about it.</i>

918
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,443
<i>They have to accept it.</i>

919
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:42,886
<i>Maybel Im just trying to make
myself feel better but it works:</i>

920
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:48,166
<i>I've never felt guilty, never been
depressed, never had nightmares.</i>

921
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:14,680
For executing me
and sending me to heaven.

922
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:20,927
I thank you a thousand
times, for everything.

923
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:56,006
This is great, Joshua.
This is very good.

924
01:43:56,200 --> 01:44:02,048
I never imagined
I could make something so great.

925
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,327
One thing that makes me
so proud -

926
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,650
- is how the waterfall
expresses such deep feelings!

927
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:23,451
You know the scene
where I'm strangled with wire?

928
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,128
- Do you have it here?
- Where you're strangled?

929
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:31,971
Please put it on.

930
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:39,322
Yan?

931
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:43,206
I want him to watch this...

932
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:53,331
- Yan?
- He's in bed.

933
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:59,522
Yan, watch the scene
where grandpa is tortured and killed.

934
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:04,362
Ami, come see grandpa beaten up
and bleeding.

935
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,608
But this is too violent.

936
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,600
Watch this.
Grandpa gets beaten up.

937
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,447
Turn up the volume.

938
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:18,167
But this is too violent, Anwar
Are you sure?

939
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,966
Yes, it's fine.
Will you be scared, Yan?

940
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,245
This is only a film...
Look at that.

941
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:36,887
Grandpa looks so sad,
doesn't he, Yan?

942
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,447
So scary

943
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:45,361
it's so sad, isn't it?
That's your grandpa.

944
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:51,890
That's grandpa being
beaten up by the fat guy.

945
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:55,129
Grandpa's head is smashed.

946
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:37,600
Did the people I tortured feel
the way I do here?

947
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:52,569
I can feel what the people
I tortured felt.

948
01:46:52,760 --> 01:47:00,760
Because here my dignity
has been destroyed...

949
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:05,645
...and then fear comes,
right there and then.

950
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:10,926
All the terror suddenly
possessed my body

951
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:15,808
it surrounded me,
and possessed me.

952
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:23,081
Actually the people you tortured
felt far worse-

953
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:28,286
- because you know it's only a film.
They knew they were being killed.

954
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,685
But I can feel it, Josh.
Really I feel it.

955
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:41,364
Or have I sinned?

956
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:50,602
I did this to so many people, Josh.

957
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,245
Is it all coming back to me?

958
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:09,284
I really hope it won't.
I don't want it to, Josh.

959
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:23,640
This is where we tortured and
killed the people we captured.

960
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:49,684
I know it was wrong -

961
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:54,041
- but I had to do it.

962
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:06,609
This is...

963
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:15,166
This is one of the easiest
ways to take a human life.

964
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:21,566
And this...

965
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,961
This was used to take away..

966
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:34,647
...the human beings we killed.

967
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:37,684
Because without this...

968
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:43,051
...maybe people would know.

968
01:51:44,305 --> 01:51:50,164
