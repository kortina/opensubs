2
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:19,687
Out west there was this fella,

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,897
fella I want to tell you about,

4
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,192
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski -

5
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:28,696
at least that's the handle
his parents gave him.

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,241
But he never had
much use for it himself.

7
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,203
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

8
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:40,708
Now, Dude, that's a name
no one would self-apply

9
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,710
where I come from.

10
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:47,590
There was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make sense to me,

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,926
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

12
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,513
But then again,

13
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:58,601
maybe that's why I found
the place so darn interesting.

14
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:06,442
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

15
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,695
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

16
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:13,032
But there are
some nice folks there.

17
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,494
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

18
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,996
and I never been to France,

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,000
and I ain't never seen
no queen in her damned undies.

20
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,087
But I'll tell you what,

21
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,339
after seeing Los Angeles

22
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,300
and this story
I'm about to unfold,

23
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:35,888
well, I guess I seen somethin'
every bit as stupefyin'

24
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,766
as you'd see
in any other places,

25
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,060
and in English, too.

26
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,979
So I can die
with a smile on my face

27
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,274
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

28
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:50,027
Now, this story
I'm about to unfold

29
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,279
took place
back in the early 90s,

30
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:57,284
about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.

31
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:00,788
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man -

32
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:05,000
I won't say a hero,
'cause what's a hero?

33
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:08,003
But sometimes there's a man -

34
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,090
and I'm talking
about the Dude here -

35
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,718
sometimes there's a man...

36
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:18,556
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

37
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,808
He fits right in there,

38
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,519
and that's the Dude,

39
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,563
in Los Angeles.

40
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,482
And even if he's a lazy man,

41
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,527
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,197
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

43
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,199
which would place him high

44
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:40,411
in the running
for laziest worldwide.

45
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,830
But sometimes there's a man,

46
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,874
sometimes...

47
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,043
there's a man...

48
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:51,088
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

49
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:54,300
But... ah, hell.

50
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,218
I done introduced him enough.

51
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:59,472
'This will not stand.

52
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:03,392
'This will not stand,
this aggression against Kuwait.'

53
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,383
Where's the money, Lebowski?

54
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:40,805
I want that money, Lebowski.
Bunny says you're good for it.

55
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,516
Where's the money, Lebowski?

56
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,810
Where's the money, Lebowski?

57
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,187
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?

58
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,776
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

59
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,779
Don't fuck with us!

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,242
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn.

61
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,370
That means you owe
money to Jackie Treehorn.

62
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,289
Ever thus
to deadbeats, Lebowski.

63
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,833
Don't do that...

64
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,295
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?

65
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,507
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

66
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,635
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong man.

67
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,429
I'm the Dude, man.

68
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:25,683
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.
Your wife is Bunny.

69
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:29,395
My... my wife... my wife, Bunny?

70
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,647
Do you see a wedding ring?

71
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,024
Does this place
look like I'm married?

72
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,485
The toilet seat's up, man.

73
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,870
What the fuck is this?

74
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,123
Obviously, you're not a golfer.

75
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:53,252
- Woo?
- Yeah?

76
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,797
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

77
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,632
Fuck!

78
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,554
- Yeah, what do you think?
- He looks like a fucking loser.

79
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,515
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

80
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:10,519
Fucking time wasted.
Thanks a lot, asshole.

81
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,611
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

82
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:27,114
This was a valued rug.
This was a...

83
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:30,117
It really
tied the room together.

84
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,328
So this was a valued...

85
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,121
- What tied the room together?
- My rug.

86
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:36,123
- Were you listening, Donny?
- What?

87
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,667
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?

88
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,127
I was bowling.

89
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:44,256
You have no frame of reference,
like a child who wanders in...

90
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,175
Walter, what's the point?

91
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,344
There's no reason -
here's my point, Dude -

92
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,805
- there's no reason...
- Yeah, what's your point?

93
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,182
- Huh?
- Walter, what is the point...

94
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,684
We know who is at fault here.

95
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,728
What the fuck
are you talking about?

96
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,564
No, what the fuck are you...
I'm not...

97
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,692
We're talking about
unchecked aggression here.

98
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,528
- What is he talking about?
- My rug.

99
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,072
Forget it,
you're out of your element.

100
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,992
The Chinaman who peed on my rug,
I can't go give him a bill.

101
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,787
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

102
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,997
The Chinaman
is not the issue here.

103
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,126
I'm talking about
drawing a line in the sand.

104
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,503
Across this line, you do not...

105
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:26,173
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.

106
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,217
"Asian-American," please.

107
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,887
This isn't a guy who built
the railroads here...

108
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:34,473
- What the fuck...
- He peed on my rug.

109
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:38,352
- He peed on the Dude's rug.
- You're out of your element!

110
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:41,313
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

111
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,691
- So, who... who...
- Jeff Lebowski.

112
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,486
The other Jeffrey Lebowski,
the millionaire.

113
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,406
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

114
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,617
Plus, he has the wealth
and the resources...

115
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,287
so there's no reason,
no fucking reason

116
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,998
why his wife
should go out, owe money,

117
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,667
and then they pee
on your fucking rug!

118
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,502
- Am I wrong?
- No.

119
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,254
- Am I wrong?
- But...

120
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,173
OK, then.

121
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:10,926
That rug really tied
the room together, did it not?

122
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,220
- Fuckin' A!
- And he peed on it.

123
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,889
Donny, please.

124
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,850
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

125
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:21,103
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

126
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:24,690
He should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

127
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:28,486
His wife owes money,
and they pee on my rug?

128
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:32,281
- They pee on your fucking rug.
- They peed on my fucking rug.

129
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,158
That's right, Dude.

130
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,453
They peed on your fucking rug.

131
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,333
This is the study.
The various commendations...

132
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,502
Jeffrey Lebowski.

133
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,797
- Honorary degrees, etcetera.
- Very impressive.

134
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,383
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

135
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,886
- Oh, I'm not really that...
- Oh, please, please.

136
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,389
That is the key
to the city of Pasadena,

137
00:09:56,472 --> 00:10:00,935
which Mr. Lebowski received in
recognition of various civic...

138
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,853
Oh, that's the Los Angeles

139
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,731
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

140
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,401
which is... not
necessarily given every year.

141
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,946
Hey, is this, uh,
is this him with Nancy?

142
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,158
Yes, indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski
with the First Lady...

143
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,828
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

144
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,539
Of course.
Mr. Lebowski on the left...

145
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,709
He's a cripple... you know,
a... handicapped guy?

146
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,254
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.
This picture was taken

147
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:31,340
when Mrs. Reagan was
First Lady of the nation.

148
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,385
- Yes, yes. Not of California.
- Pope John.

149
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,971
He met privately
with the president,

150
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,682
but there was no time
for a photo opportunity.

151
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:41,976
- Nancy's pretty good.
- Wonderful woman!

152
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,894
These are...

153
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:47,189
Those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

154
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:49,400
Different mothers?
Racially, pretty cool.

155
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,863
They're not literally
his children.

156
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,282
They're the Little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

157
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,743
inner-city children of promise

158
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,620
but without the means
for a higher education.

159
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,540
Mr. Lebowski is committed
to sending them to college.

160
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,209
Excuse me. Thank you, thank you.

161
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:10,254
Far out. Think he's
got room for one more?

162
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,631
One, uh... Oh!

163
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:17,136
You never went to college.
Please, don't touch that.

164
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,139
Yeah, I did, but I spent
most of my time...

165
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:23,267
occupying various
administration buildings,

166
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,352
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

167
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,064
breaking into the R.O.T.C.
And bowling.

168
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,608
To tell you the truth,
I don't remember much.

169
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:39,492
OK, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

170
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,494
that's terrific.

171
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,622
But I'm very busy,
as I imagine you are.

172
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,083
What can I do for you, sir?

173
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,711
Well, sir, it's this rug I have,

174
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,672
it really tied
the room together...

175
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:57,593
You told Brandt, he told me.
Where do I fit in?

176
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,930
Well, they were
looking for you, these guys.

177
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,057
I'll say it again.

178
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,310
You told Brandt
on the phone, he told me.

179
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,229
I know what happened. Yes?

180
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:11,857
So you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug?

181
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,360
Did I urinate on your rug?

182
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,029
Did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

183
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,366
Hello! Do you speak English?
Parla usted ingles?

184
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,494
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

185
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,664
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

186
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,916
I want to understand this, sir.

187
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,712
Every time a rug is
micturated upon in this city,

188
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:34,422
I have to compensate...

189
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:38,342
Come on, man, I'm not
trying to scam anybody here.

190
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:40,219
I... I was just...

191
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,764
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

192
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:46,642
Are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?

193
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:50,354
Wait, let me
explain something to you.

194
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:53,899
I am not Mr. Lebowski.
You're Mr. Lebowski.

195
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,944
I'm the Dude.
So that's what you call me,

196
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:00,448
you know, uh, that
or, uh, his Dudeness,

197
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,492
or Duder, or, you
know, uh, el Duderino,

198
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:06,704
if you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

199
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,291
- Are you employed, sir?
- Employed?

200
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,671
You don't look for a job
dressed like that on a weekday?

201
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,799
Is this a... What day is this?

202
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:22,428
Well, I do work, sir.
So if you don't mind...

203
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,847
No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

204
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,974
This will not stand, you know.

205
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:30,186
This aggression
will not stand, man.

206
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:34,231
- I mean, your wife owes...
- My wife is not the issue!

207
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:38,402
I hope that my wife will learn
to live on her ample allowance.

208
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,781
If not, that's
her problem, not mine,

209
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,866
just as the rug is your problem,

210
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,454
just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,

211
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,915
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

212
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,126
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

213
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,046
Some Chinaman
took them from me in Korea.

214
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,257
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

215
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:04,220
I cannot solve your problems,
sir, only you can.

216
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,349
- Oh, fuck it.
- "Oh, fuck it."

217
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,143
Yes, that's your answer
to everything.

218
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,686
Tattoo it on your forehead.

219
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,065
Your revolution
is over, Mr. Lebowski!

220
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,776
Condolences! The bums lost!

221
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,530
My advice to you
is to do what your parents did!

222
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,407
Get a job, sir!

223
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,661
The bums will always lose!
Do you hear me, Lebowski?

224
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,246
The bums...

225
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:34,625
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

226
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,213
OK. The old man told me
to take any rug in the house.

227
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:43,467
Well, enjoy, and perhaps
we'll see you again, Dude.

228
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:47,471
Sure, if I'm in
the neighborhood, you know,

229
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,432
and, um...

230
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,851
I need to use the john.

231
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,822
Blow on them.

232
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,283
Go ahead, blow.

233
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:12,163
You want me to blow
on your toes?

234
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:15,499
Uh-huh. I can't blow that far.

235
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,008
Are you sure he won't mind?

236
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,887
He doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

237
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,556
Oh, that must be exhausting.

238
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,433
You're not blowing.

239
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,478
He has to be getting along,
Mrs. Lebowski.

240
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,730
Oh, you're Bunny.

241
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,484
I'll suck your cock for $1,000.

242
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,365
Wonderful woman.

243
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,117
We're very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

244
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,870
Brandt can't watch,
or he has to pay 100.

245
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,456
That's marvellous.

246
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,379
I'm just gonna
go find a cash machine.

247
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,760
Whoo! Slamming them tonight!

248
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,012
You guys are dead in the water.

249
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:12,890
All right! Way to go, Donny!

250
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,685
If you will it, it is no dream.

251
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,897
You're 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

252
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,899
Theodore Herzel.

253
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:26,070
The state of Israel. If you
will it, Dude, it is no dream.

254
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,907
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

255
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,577
Oh, Cynthia's dog.
I think it's a Pomeranian.

256
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:35,830
I can't leave him,
he eats the furniture.

257
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,457
I'm watching it
while they're in Hawaii.

258
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,961
- You brought it bowling?
- "Brought it bowling"?

259
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,214
I didn't rent it shoes,
I'm not buying it a beer,

260
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,425
he's not taking your turn, Dude.

261
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,886
If my ex-wife asked me
to take care of her dog

262
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,681
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

263
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,516
I'd tell her to fuck herself.

264
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,643
Dude, you don't have an ex,

265
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:00,771
and this is a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.

266
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:05,443
You can't board it. It gets
upset. Its hair falls out.

267
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,570
Over the line!

268
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:11,115
Sorry, you were over the line.
That's a foul.

269
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,200
Bullshit. Mark it 8, Dude.

270
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:16,162
Excuse me, mark it zero.
Next frame.

271
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,497
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

272
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:21,876
This is not 'Nam, this
is bowling. There are rules.

273
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,295
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's Smokey.

274
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,548
His toe slipped over.
It's just a game.

275
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,218
It determines who enters
the round-robin. Am I wrong?

276
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,095
- Yeah, but...
- Am I wrong?

277
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,139
Yeah, but I wasn't over.

278
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,933
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an 8.

279
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:41,645
Smokey, my friend,
you're entering a world of pain.

280
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,231
- Walter...
- You mark that frame an 8,

281
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:47,234
you're entering a world of pain.

282
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,112
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.

283
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,615
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

284
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,492
Has the world gone crazy?

285
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,370
Am I the only one
who cares about the rules?

286
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,829
Mark it zero!

287
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:02,041
- They're calling the cops.
- Mark it zero!

288
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,835
- Put the piece away.
- Walter...

289
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,546
You think I'm fucking around?
Mark it zero!

290
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,555
All right, it's fucking zero.

291
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,975
You happy, you crazy fuck?

292
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,729
It's a league game, Smoke.

293
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:27,942
You can't do that, man.

294
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,403
These guys are like me.
They're pacifists.

295
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,530
Smokey was
a conscientious objector.

296
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,366
I myself dabbled in pacifism,

297
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,535
not in 'Nam, of course.

298
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,204
You know he's got
emotional problems.

299
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,623
You mean, beyond pacifism?

300
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:46,210
He's fragile, very fragile.

301
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:50,047
I did not know that.

302
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:53,300
Well, it's all
water under the bridge,

303
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:56,011
and we do enter
the next round-robin.

304
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:58,597
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.

305
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:01,934
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're just an asshole!

306
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,646
OK. We play Quintana
and O'Brien next week.

307
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,441
They should be pushovers.

308
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:11,027
Man, will you just...

309
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,362
Just take it easy, man.

310
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:15,781
That's your answer
for everything, Dude.

311
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:20,953
Look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq.

312
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,372
Pacifism is not
something to hide behind.

313
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,666
Just take it easy, man.

314
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,710
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

315
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,297
- Waving the fucking gun around?
- Calmer than you are.

316
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,090
Just take it easy!

317
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,135
Calmer than you are.

318
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:42,266
'Dude, this is Smokey.

319
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,435
'I don't want to
be a hard-on about this.

320
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,479
'I know it wasn't your fault,

321
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,982

will submit this to the league

322
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,693

323
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:54,820
'maybe forfeit it to us.

00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,740
'So, like I say,
you know, fair warning.

325
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,867

326
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,664
'Mr. Lebowski,
this is Brandt at, uh,

'This is Bill Selliger of
the Southern Cal Bowling League.

- Hey, Monty.

00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:37,238
Dude, I... I finally got...
the venue I wanted.

336
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,908
I'm performing my dance quintet,
you know, my cycle,

337
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,203
at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street Theater on Tuesday night.

338
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:48,582
And, well, I'd love it
if you came and gave me notes.

339
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,584
I'll be there, man.

340
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,465
Tomorrow's already the 10th.

341
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,426
Far out.

342
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:03,681
Oh. Oh, all right, OK.

343
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,392
Just slip the rent
under my door.

'...serious infraction

We've had terrible news.
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion.

354
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,807
Mr. Lebowski.

355
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,690
Funny...

356
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:58,861
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

357
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:01,197
challenges met,

358
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,240
competitors bested,

359
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:06,077
obstacles overcome.

360
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:10,748
I've accomplished more
than most men

361
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,417
and without the use of my legs.

362
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,087
What...

363
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,757
What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?

364
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,177
Dude.

365
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,723
I... I don't know, sir.

366
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:30,976
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

367
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,939
Whatever the cost?

368
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,858
Isn't that what makes a man?

369
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:40,027
Sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

370
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,489
You're joking. But...

371
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:47,368
Perhaps you're right.

372
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,954
You mind if I do a "J"?

373
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:52,456
Bunny...

374
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,043
Excuse me?

375
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,671
Bunny Lebowski,

376
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:01,674
she is the light of my life.

377
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,885
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

378
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,806
Fuckin' A.

379
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,143
Strong men also cry.

380
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:16,397
Strong men also cry.

381
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,861
I received this fax
this morning.

382
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,532
As you can see,

383
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,659
it is a ransom note.

384
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:31,620
"We have Bunnie."

385
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:36,208
Sent by men who can't achieve
on a level field of play.

386
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:39,003
"Gather one million dollars

387
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,131
in unmarked,
non-consecutive twenties."

388
00:23:42,214 --> 00:23:45,134
- Weaklings!
- "Await instructions."

389
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,011
- Bums!
- "No funny stuff."

390
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:50,598
- Bummer.
- Huh?

391
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,641
This is a bummer, man.

392
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,602
That's, uh, that's a bummer.

393
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:58,439
Brandt will
fill you in on the details.

394
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:15,831
Mr. Lebowski will make you
a generous offer

395
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:19,960
to act as courier once we get
instructions for the money.

396
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:21,504
Why me, man?

397
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:24,673
He believes the culprits
might be the people

398
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:27,259
who, uh... soiled your rug,

399
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:31,931
and you're in a unique position
to confirm or disconfirm this.

400
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,308
He thinks
the carpet-pissers did this?

401
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:36,936
Well, Dude, we just don't know.

402
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:15,409
Fucking Quintana.

403
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:17,912
That creep can roll, man.

404
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,039
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.

405
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,874
Yeah.

406
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:24,960
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

407
00:26:25,044 --> 00:26:28,631
He did six months for exposing
himself to an 8-year-old.

408
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,842
When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door-to-door

409
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:33,719
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

410
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:36,180
What's a pederast, Walter?

411
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:38,724
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

412
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,397
- So... How much they give you?
- 20 grand, man.

413
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,234
- And I get to keep the rug.
- Just for making a hand-off?

414
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:50,528
Yeah. They gave Dude a beeper.

415
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:54,407
- So whenever they call...
- What if it's during a game?

416
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,411
- If it's during league play...
- What's during league play?

417
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:01,539
Life doesn't stop and start
at your convenience,

418
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,750
- you piece of shit.
- What's wrong with Walter?

419
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,503
I figure it's easy money.
It's harmless.

420
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:11,173
- She probably did it herself.
- What do you mean, Dude?

421
00:27:11,257 --> 00:27:13,968
Rug pee-ers didn't do this.
Look at it.

422
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:18,013
A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

423
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:20,516
She figures
he isn't giving her enough.

424
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,560
You know, she owes money.

425
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:26,397
- That fuckin'... bitch.
- It's all goddamn fake, man.

426
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,649
It's like Lenin said.

427
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:31,819
You look for the person
who will benefit,

428
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:35,072
- and, uh, you know...
- I am the walrus?

429
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:37,533
You know, you'll, uh...

430
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,244
- You know what I'm saying.
- I am the walrus.

431
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,163
That fuckin' bitch!

432
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:45,082
- I am the walrus.
- Shut the fuck up, Donny!

433
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,710
V.I. Lenin.
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

434
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:50,087
What the fuck
is he talking about?

435
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:53,215
Fucking exactly what happened.
That makes me sick.

436
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,010
- What do you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.

437
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,928
This whole fuckin' thing.

438
00:27:58,012 --> 00:28:01,015
I didn't watch my buddies die
face-down in the mud

439
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,185
so that this fucking strumpet,
this fucking whore...

440
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:06,729
I don't see
any connection with Vietnam.

441
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,314
No literal connection.

442
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:11,359
Face it, there's no
connection. Your roll.

443
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:14,278
- But my point is...
- Your roll.

444
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:16,364
Are you ready to be fucked?

445
00:28:17,323 --> 00:28:20,910
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

446
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,662
Dios mio, man.

447
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:26,832
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

448
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:31,295
Yeah? Well... you know,
that's just like, uh...

449
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,339
your opinion, man.

450
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:37,009
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

451
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:40,137
you pull any crazy shit with us,

452
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:42,598
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

453
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:45,768
I'll take it
and stick it up your ass

454
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:49,021
and pull the fuckin' trigger
till it goes click.

455
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:53,734
- Jesus.
- You said it, man.

456
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:56,946
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

457
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:03,911
8-year-olds, Dude.

458
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:57,858
Oh, man.

459
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:09,829
They called 80 minutes ago.

460
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:12,707
Take the money,
drive north on the 405.

461
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,960
They will call you with
instructions in 40 minutes.

462
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:20,047
One person only. They were clear
on that, or I'd go with you.

463
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:22,883
- What happened to your jaw?
- Oh, nothin'.

464
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:28,139
Here's the money. And the phone.

465
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,933
Please, Dude,
follow their instructions.

466
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,476
All right.

467
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,147
- Her life is in your hands.
- Oh, man, don't say that.

468
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,232
Mr. Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

469
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,651
- Her life is in your hands.
- Shit, man.

470
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,570
Her life is in your hands, Dude.

471
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,614
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

472
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,333
Where the fuck are you goin'?

473
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,377
Take the ringer. I'll drive.

474
00:31:58,461 --> 00:32:01,130
- What? The what?
- The ringer.

475
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,174
The ringer, Dude.

476
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:12,808
- What the...
- Have they called?

477
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:16,020
- What the hell is this?
- My dirty undies, Dude.

478
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,689
Laundry. The whites.

479
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:22,526
I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies.

480
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,779
The weight.
The ringer cannot look empty.

481
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,697
What the fuck are you thinking?

482
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:29,158
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking,

483
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:32,078
why should we settle for
a measly fuckin' 20 grand...

484
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,997
We? You said
you just wanted to come along.

485
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:37,500
Why should we settle
for 20 grand

486
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,252
when we can keep
the entire million? Am I wrong?

487
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:43,172
Yes, you're wrong.
This isn't a game, man.

488
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,591
It is a game.
You said so yourself.

489
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:48,344
- She kidnapped herself.
- I said I thought...

490
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,267
Dude here.

491
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:57,478
'Who is this?'

492
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,190
Dude the bagman.
Where do you want us to go?

493
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:04,151
- 'Us?'
- Shit!

494
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:09,740
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

495
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:13,160
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car...

496
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:16,205
- 'Shut the fuck up!'
- Are you fucking this up?

497
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,374
Who is that?

498
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:21,001
That is the driver.
I told you...

499
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:25,214
- Shit!
- What the fuck's goin' on?

500
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,466
- Walter!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

501
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,886
He hung up! You fucked it up!
You fucked it up!

502
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,806
- Her life was in our hands.
- Easy, Dude.

503
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:36,267
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

504
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,311
They're gonna kill her.
We're fucked, Walter.

505
00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:42,815
Nothing is fucked, Dude.
You're being very unDude.

506
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:45,234
They'll call back.
She kidnapped...

507
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:50,281
You see?
Nothing's fucked here, Dude.

508
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,783
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs!

509
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,244
Hey, will you shut the fuck up?

510
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:58,247
Don't say peep
while I'm doin' business here.

511
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,666
OK, Dude, have it your way.

512
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:04,420
- But they're amateurs.
- Fuck.

513
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,631
- Dude.
- 'OK, we proceed,

514
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,884
'but only if there's
no funny stuff.'

515
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,844
Yeah, yeah.

516
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:13,971
'So no funny stuff, OK?'

517
00:34:14,055 --> 00:34:16,724
Just tell me
where the fuck to go.

518
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:23,022
That was the sign, man.

519
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:26,317
So all we gotta do
is get her back.

520
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,653
No one can complain,
and we keep the baksheesh.

521
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:31,364
Terrific, Walter,

522
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:33,991
but how are we
gonna get her back?

523
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,077
That's the simple part, Dude.

524
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,955
We make the hand-off,
I grab one, beat it out of him.

525
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,334
- Huh?
- Yeah. That's a great plan.

526
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,837
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

527
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:48,964
It's a Swiss fuckin' watch.

528
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:51,926
Yeah, the beauty
of this is its simplicity.

529
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,678
If it gets complex,
everything can go wrong.

530
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,847
If I learned one thing
in 'Nam, it's...

531
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:03,229
- Dude.
- 'You're coming to a bridge.

532
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,231
'When you cross the bridge,

533
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:09,694
'you throw the bag from the left
window. You're being watched.'

534
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:11,320
Fuck!

535
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:13,364
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

536
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,909
There isn't one, we throw
the money out of the car.

537
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:20,538
We throw the money
out of the moving car!

538
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,999
We can't do that.
That fucks up our plan.

539
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,252
Call 'em and explain it to them.

540
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:30,589
You're plan is so simple
I'm sure they'll understand.

541
00:35:30,673 --> 00:35:34,427
I'm throwin' the money, Walter.
We're not fuckin' around.

542
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,804
Bridge is comin' up.
Give me the ringer.

543
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:40,391
Fuck that. I love ya,
but you have to face the fact

544
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,185
- you're a goddamn moron.
- No time to argue.

545
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:44,937
- Hey, man.
- The bridge.

546
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:47,481
Hey, Walter! Hey! Walter!

547
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,775
There goes the ringer!

548
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:52,611
- What the fuck?
- Here, your wheel.

549
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:56,699
At 15 mph, I roll out,
grab one and beat it out of him.

550
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:58,617
- The Uzi.
- Uzi?

551
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:01,037
- I'm not rolling out naked.
- Walter, please!

552
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,997
15, Dude. This is it.

553
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:28,814
We have it! We have it!

554
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:32,985
We have it!

555
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,196
We... have it!

556
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,878
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

557
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,047
Let's go bowling.

558
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:34,255
Etz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

559
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:36,382
What the fuck does that mean?

560
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:38,968
What the fuck
are we gonna tell Lebowski?

561
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,970
Huh? Oh, him. Uh...

562
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,516
Well, what exactly
is the problem?

563
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,643
The problem is...

564
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:50,021
What do you mean, what's the...

565
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:52,314
There was no...

566
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,942
We... we didn't, uh...

567
00:37:55,026 --> 00:37:57,862
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

568
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:00,072
The poor woman...

569
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:03,784
That poor slut kidnapped
herself. You said so yourself.

570
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:06,454
I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

571
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:09,915
- You're the one who's certain.
- 100% certain.

572
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:12,710
- They posted the next round.
- Shut the fuck...

573
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:15,379
- When do we play?
- This Saturday.

574
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:17,548
Saturday?
They have to reschedule.

575
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,300
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

576
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,886
I told that fuck
at the league office...

577
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,638
- Who's in charge of scheduling?
- Burkhalter.

578
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:27,767
I told that kraut
I don't roll on Shabbos.

579
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,811
- He already posted it.
- He can fuckin' unpost it!

580
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:34,231
Who gives a shit?
They're gonna kill that woman.

581
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:36,400
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?

582
00:38:36,484 --> 00:38:39,278
She'll get tired
of her game and go back.

583
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:41,864
- Why not on Saturday?
- I'm Shomer Shabbos.

584
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,657
What's that?

585
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:45,701
What do I tell Lebowski?

586
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:48,496
Saturday is Shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

587
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,248
I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

588
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:54,001
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

589
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:56,253
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

590
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:58,130
Sheesh.

591
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,424
Shomer Shabbos!

592
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,595
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking Shabbos.

593
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:08,224
- That's it! I'm outta here.
- Come on, Dude.

594
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:12,144
Dude! Dude!

595
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:14,313
Look, you just tell him...

596
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:17,566
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went...

597
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,277
- How'd it go?
- Went all right.

598
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:23,698
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand-off.

599
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:26,867
They didn't get the fuckin'
money! They're gonna...

600
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:31,622
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

601
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:34,667
If you can't go by car, how
do you get around on Shammos?

602
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,627
Really, Dude, you surprise me.

603
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:39,964
They're not gonna do shit.
What can they do to her?

604
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,424
They're amateurs, and meanwhile,

605
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:45,428
who's sittin' on a million
fucking dollars? Am I wrong?

606
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:49,432
Who's got a million
fuckin' dollars in our car?

607
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,183
Our car, Walter?

608
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:55,021
What do they got? My dirty
undies. My fuckin' whites.

609
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,736
Say, Dude...

610
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:04,739
where is your car?

611
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:06,574
Who's got your undies?

612
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:09,410
- Where's your car, Dude?
- You don't know?

613
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:13,706
It was parked in a handicap
zone. Perhaps they towed it.

614
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:17,710
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

615
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:21,714
Well, certainly,
that's a possibility, Dude.

616
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,592
Oh, fuck it.

617
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,555
- Where you goin', Dude?
- I'm going home, Donny.

618
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:32,850
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny.

619
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:48,199
Uh... yeah...

620
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:54,705
Green... uh, some brown or...

621
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:57,166
rust coloration.

622
00:40:57,249 --> 00:41:00,252
Was there anything
of value in the car?

623
00:41:00,336 --> 00:41:03,130
Oh. Uh, yeah...

624
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:06,509
a tape deck,
some Creedence tapes,

625
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:08,928
and there was a... uh...

626
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:12,682
My briefcase.

627
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:15,559
In the briefcase?

628
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,897
Uh, papers.

629
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,066
You know, just papers.

630
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:25,486
You know, my papers.
Business papers.

631
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:29,365
And what do you do, sir?

632
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:31,325
I'm unemployed.

633
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,331
My rug was also stolen.

634
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:39,709
Your rug was in the car?

635
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:41,711
No, here.

636
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:44,130
Separate incidents?

637
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,800
'The Dude is not in...'

638
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:51,095
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

639
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,889
Sometimes.

640
00:41:53,973 --> 00:41:57,810
- No hope for the tape deck.
- Or the Creedence.

641
00:41:57,893 --> 00:42:01,397
Well, what about, uh...

642
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,149
The briefcase?

643
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,985
'Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

644
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:09,530
'My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.'

645
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:14,744
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

646
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,667
Elfranco, ayúdame abajo.

647
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:08,047
I'll be with you
in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

648
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:30,277
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

649
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,488
Is that what
this is a picture of?

650
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:34,156
In a sense, yes.

651
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,743
My art is strongly vaginal,
which bothers some men.

652
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:41,956
The word itself makes some
men uncomfortable. Vagina.

653
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,624
Oh, yeah?

654
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:47,128
They find it difficult to say,
but without batting an eye,

655
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:51,298
a man will refer to his dick
or his rod or his... johnson.

656
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,969
- Johnson?
- All right, Mr. Lebowski.

657
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:56,846
Let's get down to cases.

658
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:59,306
My father agreed
to let you have the rug,

659
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,809
but it was a gift from me
to my late mother,

660
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:03,853
and not his to give. Now...

661
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:05,938
Your face.

662
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:08,524
As for this kidnapping...

663
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:12,778
I know all about it,
and that you acted as courier.

664
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:17,074
Let me tell you something.
It stinks to high heaven.

665
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:20,453
Right, but let me explain
something about the rug.

666
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:23,873
- Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
- Excuse me?

667
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:26,042
Sex. The physical act of love.

668
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,210
Coitus. Do you like it?

669
00:44:28,294 --> 00:44:30,254
I was talking about my rug.

670
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,841
- You're not interested in sex?
- You mean coitus?

671
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:37,928
I like it. It's a myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

672
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:42,016
It can be a natural, zesty
enterprise. But some people -

673
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:44,810
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women -

674
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:47,563
engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

675
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:50,983
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

676
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:54,820
They cannot love
in the true sense of the word.

677
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:58,324
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

678
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,368
Listen, Maude,

679
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:04,330
um, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

680
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,124
but what has that
to do with, uh...

681
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:10,961
- Do you have any Kahlua?
- Take a look at this, sir.

682
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,592
Oh, I know that guy.

683
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:19,261
He's a nihilist.

684
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,807
Karl Hungus...

685
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,698
- 'Hi.
- Hello. Meine dispatcher says

686
00:45:38,781 --> 00:45:41,492
'there's something
wrong mit deine kabel.

687
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:44,829
'Come in. I'm not sure
exactly what's wrong.

688
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:47,623
'Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

689
00:45:47,707 --> 00:45:48,708
'The TV's in here.'

690
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:51,127
You recognize her, of course.

691
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:58,384
'That's my friend. She came
over to use the shower.'

692
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,678
The story is ludicrous.

693
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:03,848
'Meine name is Karl.
Ich bin expert.'

694
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,808
'You're here to fix the cable.'

695
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:09,478
You can imagine
where it goes from here.

696
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:13,107
- He fixes the cable?
- Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

697
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,527
Little matter that she pursues
a career in pornography

698
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,863
nor that she's been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

699
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:21,365
to use the parlance
of our times.

700
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:25,327
But I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

701
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:27,288
the other being my father.

702
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,290
The Foundation
takes youngsters...

703
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,208
Shit, yeah, the achievers.

704
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:33,919
Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers, yes.

705
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:37,131
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million,

706
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,884
and he told me
about this abduction.

707
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,928
It is preposterous.
This compulsive fornicator

708
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:45,389
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

709
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:47,808
- But my...
- I'm getting to your rug.

710
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,769
My father and I don't get along.

711
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:53,105
We don't approve
of each other's lifestyles.

712
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:57,026
But I hardly wish to make his
embezzlement a police matter.

713
00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:01,447
I propose that you try
to recover the money.

714
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,992
Well, I could do that.

715
00:47:05,076 --> 00:47:08,037
If you do so,
I will compensate you

716
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,165
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

717
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:12,833
A hundred...

718
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:17,463
...thousand, yes, bones or clams
or whatever you call them.

719
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:21,258
Yeah, but...
what about my, uh...

720
00:47:21,342 --> 00:47:24,428
Your rug. With that money
you can buy any rug

721
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:27,181
that doesn't have
sentimental value for me.

722
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:29,266
I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

723
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,019
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even, uh...

724
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:34,855
Here's the number of a doctor
who will look at it.

725
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:37,817
You'll receive no bill.
He's a good man.

726
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,736
- That's thoughtful, but...
- Please see him.

727
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,655
He's a good man.

728
00:47:44,532 --> 00:47:47,159
Oh, well... all right.

729
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,287
He says, "My wife's a pain.

730
00:47:50,496 --> 00:47:52,581
"She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

731
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:55,459
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard,

732
00:47:55,543 --> 00:47:58,254
"and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

733
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:02,174
"I can't sit down. But you
know me, can't complain."

734
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:05,428
Fuckin' A, man.
I got a rash, man.

735
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:07,263
Fuckin' A.

736
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:09,473
I gotta tell you, man,

737
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:13,060
earlier in the day,
I was feeling shitty, man.

738
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:14,812
Down in the dumps.

739
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,939
Lost a little money...

740
00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:20,443
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.

741
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:24,321
I can't be worried about
that shit. Life goes on, man.

742
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:26,365
Home, sweet home, Mr. L.

743
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:33,831
Look. Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

744
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:38,502
Yeah, he followed us here.

745
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:41,881
When did he start foll...
What the fuck?

746
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:44,550
In the limo, you son of a bitch.
No arguing.

747
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:46,969
Careful, man.
There's a beverage here.

748
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:51,265
Start talking and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

749
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:53,768
We've been trying
to reach you, Dude.

750
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:56,687
Where's my goddamn money,
you bum?

751
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,647
W-well, we...

752
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:00,483
I don't...

753
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:03,736
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

754
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:07,615
- Her life was in your hands!
- This is our concern, Dude.

755
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:10,284
No, man, nothing is fucked here.

756
00:49:10,368 --> 00:49:12,370
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.

757
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:15,664
The goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain!

758
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:19,543
Come on, who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

759
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:21,754
We dropped off the damn money.

760
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:23,756
We?

761
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,883
I.

762
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:29,679
The royal we.
You know, the editorial.

763
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:32,473
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

764
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,975
I've got certain
information, all right?

765
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:37,770
Certain things
have come to light, and...

766
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,398
Has it ever occurred to you

767
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:44,694
that instead of,
you know, running around,

768
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:48,531
blaming me, given the nature
of all this new shit,

769
00:49:48,614 --> 00:49:52,451
this could be a lot more...

770
00:49:52,535 --> 00:49:54,537
Complex?

771
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,958
I mean, it might not be
such a simple, uh... you know?

772
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:02,128
What in God's name
are you blathering about?

773
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:05,673
I'll tell you
what I'm blathering about.

774
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:09,051
I've got information.
New shit has come to light.

775
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:11,345
And, shit, man...

776
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:15,141
She kidnapped herself.

777
00:50:17,435 --> 00:50:19,270
Well, sure, man.

778
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:22,356
Look at it.
A young trophy wife,

779
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,692
in the parlance of our times.

780
00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:27,820
She owes money all over town,

781
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:30,906
including to
known pornographers.

782
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:34,952
And that's cool. That's cool.

783
00:50:35,036 --> 00:50:38,164
I'm saying she needs money, man.

784
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:40,499
And... and, you know,

785
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:43,627
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

786
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:46,797
because she wants more, man.

787
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:50,217
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

788
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:55,639
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man? Sir?

789
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:01,645
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred to me.

790
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:05,232
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

791
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:08,569
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

792
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,863
you know. But...

793
00:51:10,946 --> 00:51:14,241
Hey, that's what you pay me for.

794
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:19,163
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could...

795
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,374
give me my 20,000 in cash?

796
00:51:21,457 --> 00:51:24,960
My concern is... and I gotta
check with my accountant...

797
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:27,797
but this might bump me
into a higher tax...

798
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,216
Brandt... Give him the envelope.

799
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:34,428
Oh, if you've already got the
check made out, that's cool.

800
00:51:34,512 --> 00:51:37,014
We received this this morning.

801
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:41,894
Since you have
failed to achieve,

802
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:45,398
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

803
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:49,235
since you have stolen my money,

804
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:52,488
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

805
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:54,365
I have no choice

806
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:59,453
but to tell these bums
to do whatever is necessary

807
00:51:59,537 --> 00:52:04,542
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

808
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:08,212
With Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this:

809
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:12,800
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

810
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:16,387
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

811
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:23,936
By God, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

812
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:32,069
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

813
00:52:32,153 --> 00:52:36,073
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?

814
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:38,743
Nothing about it indicates...

815
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:41,328
- The nail polish, Walter.
- Fine, Dude.

816
00:52:41,412 --> 00:52:45,499
You can get nail polish and
apply it to someone else's toe.

817
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,585
Where the fuck
are they gonna get...

818
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:50,671
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

819
00:52:50,755 --> 00:52:52,923
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

820
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:55,176
You don't wanna know about it.

821
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:59,138
I can get you a toe
by 3 pm, with nail polish.

822
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:02,224
These fuckin' amateurs.
They send us a toe,

823
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:05,895
we're supposed to shit ourselves
with fear. Jesus Christ!

824
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:09,065
They're gonna kill her
and then me.

825
00:53:09,148 --> 00:53:12,526
Dude... that's...

826
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:15,529
That's just
the stress talking, man.

827
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,823
We have what appears to me

828
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:20,576
to be a series
of victimless crimes.

829
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:24,997
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!

830
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:28,292
Could you keep your voices down?
This is a family restaurant.

831
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:30,628
Dear, for your information,

832
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:34,173
the Supreme Court
has rejected prior restraint!

833
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:36,050
This is not
a First Amendment thing.

834
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:39,303
If you don't calm down,
you'll have to leave.

835
00:53:39,387 --> 00:53:42,682
Lady, my buddies died
face-down in the muck

836
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:45,726
so we could enjoy
this family restaurant!

837
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:48,562
- I'm outta here.
- Dude, don't go away, man.

838
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:50,523
This affects all of us.

839
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:52,441
There are basic freedoms!

840
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:59,323
I'm stayin'.

841
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:02,660
I'm finishing my coffee.

842
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:10,543
Enjoying my coffee.

843
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:28,686
'The Dude is not in.

844
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:31,731
'Leave a message after the beep.
Thanks, man.'

845
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:36,569
'Mr. Lebowski, this is duty
officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.

846
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:38,904
'We've recovered
your automobile.

847
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:41,032
'It can be claimed at...'

848
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:43,951
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

849
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,214
Hey! This is
a private residence, man.

850
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:08,309
Ah, nice marmot.

851
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:22,448
Vere is the money, Lebowski.
Ve vant the money, Lebowski.

852
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:31,499
You zink ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?

853
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:34,335
Things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski.

854
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:37,254
Ve believes in nossing,
Lebowski, nossing.

855
00:55:37,338 --> 00:55:40,216
Ve come back
and ve cut off your chonson.

856
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:41,801
Excuse me?

857
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,845
I said we'll
cut off your johnson!

858
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:46,847
Just think about that, Lebowski.

859
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:48,849
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

860
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:51,727
Maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

861
00:56:01,153 --> 00:56:03,072
It was discovered last night

862
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:06,367
- lodged against an abutment.
- Oh, man, lodged where?

863
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,620
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

864
00:56:09,704 --> 00:56:11,580
A joyride situation.

865
00:56:11,664 --> 00:56:14,542
They abandon the vehicle
once they hit the wall.

866
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:18,003
My fucking briefcase!
Man, it's not here. Shit!

867
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:19,839
I saw the report. Sorry.

868
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,425
You gotta get in
on the other side.

869
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:27,054
The side-view was found
on the road by the car.

870
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:31,017
You're lucky they left the
tape deck, and the Creedence.

871
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,645
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

872
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:37,565
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

873
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:39,734
or just used it as a toilet.

874
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:42,153
Hey, man...

875
00:56:42,236 --> 00:56:45,197
Are you gonna find
these guys, you know...

876
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:48,534
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

877
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:51,746
Leads? Yeah, sure.

878
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:55,875
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

879
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:59,295
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

880
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,797
They got us working in shifts.

881
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:08,637
Leads?

882
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:10,806
I hope the big Lebowski kills me

883
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,310
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

884
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:18,189
That is just ridiculous, Dude.
No one'll cut your dick off.

885
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,192
- Thank you.
- Not if I have anything to say.

886
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:23,861
- That makes me feel secure.
- Dude.

887
00:57:23,944 --> 00:57:26,781
- It makes me feel warm inside.
- Now, Dude.

888
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:29,116
This whole fuckin' thing.

889
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,662
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on my rug.

890
00:57:33,746 --> 00:57:36,707
- But, no, man, I gotta...
- Fucking Germans.

891
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:39,835
Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.

892
00:57:39,919 --> 00:57:42,254
They were Nazis, Dude?

893
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:45,466
Come on, Donny, they
were threatening castration.

894
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,593
- Are we gonna split hairs?
- No.

895
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:49,679
- Am I wrong?
- Well, he...

896
00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:51,430
They were nihilists, man.

897
00:57:51,514 --> 00:57:53,974
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

898
00:57:54,058 --> 00:57:56,727
Nihilists.

899
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:59,313
Fuck me.

900
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:03,859
Say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism,

901
00:58:03,943 --> 00:58:06,153
at least it's an ethos.

902
00:58:06,237 --> 00:58:08,989
And also,
let's not forget, Dude,

903
00:58:09,073 --> 00:58:12,535
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent

904
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:15,287
for, you know, domestic...

905
00:58:15,371 --> 00:58:17,331
within the city...

906
00:58:17,415 --> 00:58:19,375
That ain't legal either.

907
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,712
- Are you a fucking park ranger?
- No, I'm just...

908
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:25,840
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

909
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:29,176
- We are sympathizing, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.

910
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,305
I don't need your fucking
sympathy. I need my johnson.

911
00:58:33,389 --> 00:58:36,767
- What do you need that for?
- You've got to buck up!

912
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:40,312
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

913
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:43,482
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

914
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:46,527
Fuck the tournament?

915
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:50,489
OK, Dude. I can see you
don't want to be cheered up.

916
00:58:50,573 --> 00:58:53,909
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

917
00:58:57,496 --> 00:59:00,833
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.

918
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:05,087
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

919
00:59:05,171 --> 00:59:07,256
That's right, Dude.

920
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:32,448
Do you have a good Sarsaparilla?

921
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:34,533
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

922
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:37,119
Yeah. That's a good one.

923
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:41,165
How you doin' there, Dude?

924
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:44,168
Not too good, man.

925
00:59:44,251 --> 00:59:48,089
- One of those days, huh?
- Yeah.

926
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:49,799
Well...

927
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,760
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

928
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:56,138
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and..."

929
00:59:56,222 --> 00:59:58,432
Much obliged.

930
00:59:58,516 --> 01:00:01,060
"And sometimes the bar, well...

931
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:02,937
"he eats you."

932
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,357
That some kind of Eastern thing?

933
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:09,235
Far from it.

934
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:17,368
I like your style, Dude.

935
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,829
Hmm. Well...

936
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:22,248
I dig your style, too, man.

937
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,834
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

938
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:30,047
Thankee.

939
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:34,010
- There's just one thing, Dude.
- What's that?

940
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:37,471
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

941
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:41,892
What the fuck
are you talking about?

942
01:00:44,103 --> 01:00:47,231
OK, Dude, have it your way.

943
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:50,985
Take her easy, Dude.

944
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:53,487
Yeah. Thanks, man.

945
01:00:58,576 --> 01:01:00,911
Call for you, Dude.

946
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:05,624
Hello?

947
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:08,753
'Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.'

948
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:12,048
Uh, oh, yeah.
No... no, I haven't yet.

949
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:14,717
'I'd like to
see you immediately.'

950
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,427
Oh?

951
01:01:27,438 --> 01:01:32,068
- So you're Lebowski.
- Yeah.

952
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:36,739
Maude has told me all about you.

953
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:39,992
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

954
01:01:40,076 --> 01:01:43,454
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, sure. White Russian.

955
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:46,082
The bar's over there.

956
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:54,590
- So what do you do, Lebowski?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

957
01:01:56,342 --> 01:01:58,219
Just a friend of Maudie's.

958
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,429
The friend
with the cleft asshole?

959
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:05,142
What do you do?

960
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:07,269
Oh, nothing much.

961
01:02:07,353 --> 01:02:09,397
Hello, Jeffrey.

962
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,775
Yeah, how are you?
Listen, Maude,

963
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:15,444
I got to, uh...

964
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:18,906
tender my resignation
or whatever.

965
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:24,245
It looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.

966
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:26,122
She most certainly was not.

967
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:29,291
Hey, man,
why don't you fucking...

968
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,586
listen occasionally?
You might learn something.

969
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:35,548
- Now, I got...
- Don't call her my mother.

970
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:39,343
She's the perpetrator
and not the victim.

971
01:02:39,427 --> 01:02:42,304
I got pretty
definitive evidence...

972
01:02:42,388 --> 01:02:45,349
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.

973
01:02:45,433 --> 01:02:48,477
Uli Kunkel? Her co-star
in the beaver picture?

974
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:51,355
Beaver? You mean vagina...

975
01:02:51,439 --> 01:02:53,774
I mean, you know the guy?

976
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:56,861
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

977
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,946
Do you remember Uli?

978
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:02,450
He's a musician.
Used to have a group, Autobahn.

979
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:05,828
They released
one album in the late 70s.

980
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:09,081
Their music is
sort of a... technopop.

981
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:11,584
So he's pretending
to be the abductor?

982
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,878
- Well, yeah.
- Look, Jeffrey,

983
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:16,630
you don't kidnap someone
you're acquainted with.

984
01:03:16,714 --> 01:03:19,258
The idea is that the hostage
can't identify you

985
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:21,886
- after you've let them go.
- I know that.

986
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:29,602
What the fuck
is with this guy? Who is he?

987
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:33,230
Knox Harrington.
The video artist.

988
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:36,942
- So Uli has the money?
- Well...

989
01:03:37,026 --> 01:03:39,487
No, not exactly...

990
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:42,365
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

991
01:03:42,448 --> 01:03:46,077
A lot of ins and outs
and what-have-yous...

992
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,246
A lot of strands
to keep in my head.

993
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,707
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

994
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:53,250
Then who has the money?

995
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:56,212
It's Sandra, about the Biennale.

996
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:59,799
I have to take this. Do you
have that doctor's number?

997
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:03,344
- It's not bruised any more.
- Please, Jeffrey,

998
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:07,181
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed after-effects.

999
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,018
After-effects?

1000
01:04:40,131 --> 01:04:43,551
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr. Lebowski, please?

1001
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:46,470
No, man. She hit me right here.

1002
01:04:46,554 --> 01:04:48,305
I understand.

1003
01:04:48,389 --> 01:04:52,059
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1004
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:24,879
He lives in North Hollywood,

1005
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:27,048
on Radford,
near the In 'n' Out Burger.

1006
01:07:27,131 --> 01:07:28,966
The In 'n' Out Burger's
on Camrose.

1007
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:31,302
- Near it.
- Those are good burgers.

1008
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,220
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1009
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:36,265
The kid's in ninth grade,
and his father...

1010
01:07:36,349 --> 01:07:40,436
Are you ready for this? His
father is Arthur Digby Sellers.

1011
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,355
Who the fuck is that?

1012
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:44,982
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

1013
01:07:45,066 --> 01:07:48,319
Ever heard of a show
called "Branded"?

1014
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:51,697
"All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek"?

1015
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:53,908
I know the fucking show.
So what?

1016
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:57,870
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1017
01:07:57,953 --> 01:08:00,581
The bulk of the series.

1018
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:03,209
- Not exactly a lightweight.
- No.

1019
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:06,879
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1020
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:09,382
We'll go there
after the what-have-you,

1021
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:11,342
we'll brace the kid.

1022
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:13,427
We'll be near
the In 'n' Out Burger.

1023
01:08:13,511 --> 01:08:15,971
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

1024
01:08:16,055 --> 01:08:19,892
We'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

1025
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:22,186
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back...

1026
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,230
If he hasn't spent it already.

1027
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:26,273
A million fucking clams.

1028
01:08:26,357 --> 01:08:29,694
- Yes, we'll be near the, uh...
- In 'n' Out.

1029
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:34,490
Some burgers, some beers,
a few laughs.

1030
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:39,704
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1031
01:08:50,548 --> 01:08:53,759
Oh, fuck me, man!

1032
01:08:53,843 --> 01:08:56,971
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

1033
01:08:57,054 --> 01:08:59,557
New 'vette? Hardly, Dude.

1034
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,269
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

1035
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:06,605
depending on the options.
Wait in the car, Donny.

1036
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:12,528
- Yes?
- Pilar?

1037
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:15,281
My name is Walter Sobchak.

1038
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:18,409
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

1039
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:22,455
We came to talk about
little Larry. May we come in?

1040
01:09:22,538 --> 01:09:24,707
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

1041
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:31,464
That's him, Dude.

1042
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:41,432
And a good day to you, sir!

1043
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:43,893
Sit down, please.

1044
01:09:48,356 --> 01:09:51,192
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

1045
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:54,695
Is he... Does he still write?

1046
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:57,865
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

1047
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:03,954
Sir, I just want to say

1048
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:07,500
that we're both,
on a personal level,

1049
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,585
really enormous fans.

1050
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:12,713
"Branded", especially
the early episodes,

1051
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:15,216
was truly a source
of inspiration...

1052
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:17,885
Sweetie, sit down!
This is the police.

1053
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:21,555
Oh, no, ma'am,
we are not exactly the police.

1054
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:24,141
We hope it won't
be necessary to call the police.

1055
01:10:24,225 --> 01:10:26,894
But that's up
to little Larry here.

1056
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:29,313
Isn't it, Larry?

1057
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,325
Is this your homework, Larry?

1058
01:10:43,828 --> 01:10:45,871
- Is this your homework?
- Look, man...

1059
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:49,333
Dude, please.
Is this your homework, Larry?

1060
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:51,210
Just ask him about the car.

1061
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:54,380
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- Is that your car out front?

1062
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,675
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- We know it's his homework!

1063
01:10:57,758 --> 01:10:59,343
Where's the fucking money?

1064
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:01,470
Look, Larry...

1065
01:11:01,554 --> 01:11:03,222
Have you heard of Vietnam?

1066
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:06,308
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

1067
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:08,352
We know that you stole the car.

1068
01:11:08,436 --> 01:11:10,479
- And the fucking money!
- And the fucking money.

1069
01:11:10,563 --> 01:11:12,690
We know that this
is your homework.

1070
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:15,776
- We'll cut your dick off.
- You're killing your father.

1071
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,198
All right. This is pointless.

1072
01:11:21,282 --> 01:11:24,160
OK? It's time for plan B.

1073
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:30,583
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1074
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,501
Son, this is what happens

1075
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:34,837
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

1076
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:38,174
Little language problem here.

1077
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:41,635
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

1078
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:43,471
Walter!

1079
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:45,556
What... what are you doing, man?

1080
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,810
What are you doing?

1081
01:11:51,437 --> 01:11:54,940
Here you go, Larry.
You see what happens?

1082
01:11:55,024 --> 01:11:57,568
You see what happens, Larry?

1083
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:01,781
This is what happens

1084
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,076
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

1085
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,037
This is what happens, Larry!

1086
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,414
You see what happens, Larry,

1087
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:13,000
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1088
01:12:13,084 --> 01:12:14,669
This is what happens.

1089
01:12:14,752 --> 01:12:16,545
You see what happens, Larry?

1090
01:12:17,922 --> 01:12:19,840
You see what happens, Larry?

1091
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:21,592
Do you see what happens, Larry,

1092
01:12:21,676 --> 01:12:23,969
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1093
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:28,391
This is what happens, Larry!
This is what happens, Larry!

1094
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:30,726
- No!
- This is what happens, Larry!

1095
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,521
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

1096
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,856
What the fuck
are you doing? Stop it!

1097
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,484
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1098
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:41,696
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1099
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:44,156
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

1100
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,826
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1101
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,619
No! That's not his... hey!

1102
01:12:48,703 --> 01:12:51,497
- God damn it!
- No! Oh, no!

1103
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:54,542
Fuck you! You like that?

1104
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:57,795
Fuck you!
I kill your fucking car!

1105
01:12:57,878 --> 01:13:01,215
I kill your fucking car!

1106
01:13:21,277 --> 01:13:23,446
I accept your apology.

1107
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:29,452
No. I just... want to
handle it by myself from now on.

1108
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:31,912
No, no, no.

1109
01:13:31,996 --> 01:13:34,749
That has nothing to do with it.

1110
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:37,376
Yes, the car made it home.

1111
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,879
You're calling me at home.

1112
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:45,593
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack.

1113
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:49,638
Well, that's your perception.

1114
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:53,476
You know, Walter, you're right.

1115
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:56,562
There is an unspoken message
here. It's "Fuck you"!

1116
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:58,773
Leave me the fuck alone!

1117
01:14:00,983 --> 01:14:03,361
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1118
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:24,423
Pin your diapers on. Jackie
Treehorn wants to see you.

1119
01:14:24,507 --> 01:14:27,593
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

1120
01:14:27,677 --> 01:14:30,346
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

1121
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:32,306
You're not dealing with morons.

1122
01:15:19,854 --> 01:15:23,024
Hello, Dude. Thanks for coming.

1123
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:25,192
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1124
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:30,614
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1125
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:33,117
Completely unspoiled.

1126
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,328
- What's your drink, Dude?
- White Russian. Thanks.

1127
01:15:36,412 --> 01:15:38,330
White Russian.

1128
01:15:38,414 --> 01:15:40,916
How's the smut business, Jackie?

1129
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,710
I wouldn't know, Dude.

1130
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:45,546
I deal in publishing,

1131
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:47,840
entertainment,
political advocacy.

1132
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:51,552
- Oh. Which one's "Logjammin'"?
- Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1133
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:54,722
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1134
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:56,682
It's video, Dude.

1135
01:15:56,766 --> 01:15:59,310
Now that we're
competing with amateurs,

1136
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:02,229
we can't afford to invest
in extras, like story,

1137
01:16:02,313 --> 01:16:04,607
production value,

1138
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,776
feelings.

1139
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:09,945
You know, people forget

1140
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:13,741
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

1141
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:15,826
On you maybe.

1142
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:17,995
You have to take
the good with the bad.

1143
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:20,998
New technology permits us
to do exciting things

1144
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:25,336
in interactive erotic software.
Wave of the future, Dude.

1145
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,880
100% electronic.

1146
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:31,676
Well...
I still jerk off manually.

1147
01:16:33,052 --> 01:16:34,553
Of course you do.

1148
01:16:34,637 --> 01:16:38,224
I can see you're anxious
for me to get to the point.

1149
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,101
Well, here it is, Dude.

1150
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:42,144
Where's Bunny?

1151
01:16:42,228 --> 01:16:45,481
- I thought you might know that.
- Why would I?

1152
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:49,527
She ran off to get away from
that sizable debt to me.

1153
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:52,238
She didn't run off.
She's been...

1154
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:54,198
I've heard that story.

1155
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:57,618
I know you're
mixed up in this, Dude.

1156
01:16:57,702 --> 01:17:01,288
I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1157
01:17:01,372 --> 01:17:03,165
That's your business.

1158
01:17:03,249 --> 01:17:05,251
All I'm saying is...

1159
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,670
- I want mine.
- Yeah, right, man.

1160
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:10,506
There are a lot of...
facets to this,

1161
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:13,467
a lot of interested parties.

1162
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:16,178
Excuse me.

1163
01:17:21,392 --> 01:17:22,977
Yeah?

1164
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,437
Oh, yeah.

1165
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,105
Where's that?

1166
01:17:29,025 --> 01:17:30,943
All right.

1167
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,323
Excuse me.

1168
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:14,862
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.

1169
01:18:14,945 --> 01:18:16,989
So, uh...

1170
01:18:17,073 --> 01:18:20,159
If I, uh, can find your money...

1171
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:23,829
What's in it for the Dude?

1172
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:26,499
Of course, there's that
to discuss. Refill?

1173
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:28,417
The Pope shit in the woods?

1174
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:31,128
10% finder's fee.
That all right?

1175
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:33,881
OK. Done, Jackie.

1176
01:18:33,964 --> 01:18:36,342
I dig the way
you do business, man.

1177
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:40,721
Your money is being held
by a kid named Larry Sellers.

1178
01:18:40,805 --> 01:18:43,849
He lives in North Hollywood,
on Radford, uh...

1179
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:46,727
by the In 'n' Out Burger.

1180
01:18:46,811 --> 01:18:49,063
A fuckin' brat,

1181
01:18:49,146 --> 01:18:51,065
but I'm sure
you can get it off him.

1182
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:53,693
I mean, he's 15.

1183
01:18:54,694 --> 01:18:57,154
Flunking social studies.

1184
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:02,618
So, if you could just, uh...

1185
01:19:02,702 --> 01:19:07,623
write me a check
for my 10% of half a million...

1186
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:10,626
five grand...
I'll go out and mingle.

1187
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:18,634
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

1188
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:21,012
A 15-year-old kid.

1189
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:24,682
Is this some sort of a joke?

1190
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:26,767
No, no joke.

1191
01:19:26,851 --> 01:19:30,521
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

1192
01:19:30,604 --> 01:19:32,773
Hi, fellas.

1193
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:36,610
The kid just wanted a car.

1194
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:43,409
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1195
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:44,827
I'm not greedy.

1196
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:49,290
It really...

1197
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:51,083
tied the room together.

1198
01:19:54,045 --> 01:19:57,715
Darkness washed over the Dude.

1199
01:19:57,798 --> 01:20:00,426
Darker than
a black steer's tookus

1200
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:03,679
on a moonless prairie night.

1201
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,598
There was no bottom.

1202
01:23:58,331 --> 01:24:00,249
Branded!

1203
01:24:14,013 --> 01:24:16,682
Is this your only I. D?

1204
01:24:16,766 --> 01:24:19,018
I know my rights, man.

1205
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,649
- You don't know shit, Lebowski.
- I want a fucking lawyer, man.

1206
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:29,779
I want... Bill Kunstler, man...

1207
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:32,656
or Ron Coobie.

1208
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,492
Mr. Treehorn tells us

1209
01:24:34,575 --> 01:24:38,746
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

1210
01:24:38,829 --> 01:24:40,831
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1211
01:24:40,915 --> 01:24:46,170
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1212
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:49,465
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1213
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:51,884
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1214
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:55,304
We got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1215
01:24:55,388 --> 01:24:57,723
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1216
01:24:57,807 --> 01:24:59,892
So let me make something plain.

1217
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,520
I don't like you sucking around,

1218
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:04,605
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

1219
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:07,191
I don't like your jerk-off name,

1220
01:25:07,274 --> 01:25:09,068
I don't like your jerk-off face,

1221
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:11,612
I don't like
your jerk-off behavior,

1222
01:25:11,696 --> 01:25:14,824
and I don't like you... Jerk-off.

1223
01:25:17,243 --> 01:25:19,328
Do I make myself clear?

1224
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:24,625
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1225
01:25:27,211 --> 01:25:29,255
Fucking fascist!

1226
01:25:30,339 --> 01:25:33,175
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

1227
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:35,636
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

1228
01:25:37,263 --> 01:25:41,434
Keep your ugly goldbricking ass
out of my beach community.

1229
01:25:53,738 --> 01:25:57,366
Jesus... Man, could you
change the channel.

1230
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:00,953
If you don't like my music,
get your own fucking cab!

1231
01:26:01,037 --> 01:26:03,539
I'll pull over
and kick your ass out.

1232
01:26:03,622 --> 01:26:07,376
I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles.

1233
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:18,304
Out of my fucking cab!
Out! Get...

1234
01:26:18,387 --> 01:26:20,556
Hey... man!

1235
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,808
Man, hey!

1236
01:27:04,642 --> 01:27:07,937
Oh... Jesus.

1237
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:28,082
Jeffrey.

1238
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:30,626
Maude?

1239
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:32,670
Love me.

1240
01:27:34,088 --> 01:27:35,965
Uh, that's my robe.

1241
01:27:37,133 --> 01:27:40,302
Tell me about yourself, Jeffrey.

1242
01:27:40,386 --> 01:27:42,763
Well, not much to tell.

1243
01:27:42,847 --> 01:27:47,810
I, um, I was one of the authors

1244
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:50,104
of the Port Huron statement.

1245
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:52,148
The original
Port Huron statement.

1246
01:27:54,358 --> 01:27:58,237
Not the compromised
second draft.

1247
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:01,157
Uh, and then I, uh,

1248
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,367
you ever hear of the Seattle 7?

1249
01:28:03,451 --> 01:28:06,912
That was me.

1250
01:28:06,996 --> 01:28:11,792
And, um, the six other guys.

1251
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:15,921
Um... and then,
ah, music business briefly.

1252
01:28:17,757 --> 01:28:20,468
- Yeah, a roadie for Metallica.
- Oh.

1253
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:24,347
- "Speed of Sound" tour.
- Mm-hmm.

1254
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:26,891
Bunch of assholes.

1255
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:29,643
Uh, and then, you know,

1256
01:28:29,727 --> 01:28:31,854
a little of this,
a little of that.

1257
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:35,358
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1258
01:28:35,441 --> 01:28:39,695
What do you do for recreation?

1259
01:28:39,779 --> 01:28:45,076
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

1260
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:48,204
The occasional acid flashback.

1261
01:28:53,793 --> 01:28:56,587
What happened to your house?

1262
01:28:56,671 --> 01:28:58,756
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1263
01:28:58,839 --> 01:29:01,592
He thought I had
your father's money.

1264
01:29:01,676 --> 01:29:04,512
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1265
01:29:04,595 --> 01:29:07,181
- Cocktail?
- No, thanks.

1266
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:10,434
It's not my father's money.
It's the Foundation's.

1267
01:29:10,518 --> 01:29:14,146
Why did he think you have it?
And who does?

1268
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:16,816
Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

1269
01:29:16,899 --> 01:29:18,484
Real fucking brat.

1270
01:29:18,567 --> 01:29:22,738
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1271
01:29:22,822 --> 01:29:25,866
Lotta ins, lotta outs.
You know, fortunately,

1272
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:28,452
I'm adhering
to a pretty strict...

1273
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:31,706
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

1274
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:33,582
uh, limber, you know.

1275
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,710
Very close
to your father's money.

1276
01:29:35,793 --> 01:29:39,672
It's the Foundation's money.
Father doesn't have any.

1277
01:29:41,549 --> 01:29:44,218
What are you talking about?
He's loaded.

1278
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:47,054
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

1279
01:29:47,138 --> 01:29:49,348
No, he runs stuff, uh...

1280
01:29:49,432 --> 01:29:52,852
We did let him run a company,
but he didn't do very well.

1281
01:29:52,935 --> 01:29:55,938
- No, he's...
- He administers the charities,

1282
01:29:56,022 --> 01:29:59,066
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1283
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:01,068
He has no money of his own.

1284
01:30:01,152 --> 01:30:04,613
I know how he presents himself.
Father's weakness is vanity.

1285
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:10,328
- Hence, the slut.
- Uh, do you think he, uh...

1286
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,706
What is that, yoga?

1287
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:16,292
It increases
the chances of conception.

1288
01:30:17,918 --> 01:30:20,171
- Increases?
- Well, yes.

1289
01:30:20,254 --> 01:30:23,424
What did you think this
was about? Fun and games?

1290
01:30:23,507 --> 01:30:25,926
I want a child.

1291
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,304
OK, yeah, OK, but let me...

1292
01:30:28,387 --> 01:30:31,766
Let me explain
something about the Dude.

1293
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:34,643
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

1294
01:30:34,727 --> 01:30:38,647
I don't want the father
to be someone I have to see,

1295
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:42,735
or who has any interest
in raising the child himself.

1296
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:45,738
Oh, so that doctor...

1297
01:30:45,821 --> 01:30:47,823
Exactly.

1298
01:30:47,907 --> 01:30:50,076
Now, what happened to your face?

1299
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,912
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?

1300
01:30:52,995 --> 01:30:56,874
No, uh, it was
the Chief of Police of Malibu.

1301
01:30:56,957 --> 01:31:00,544
A real reactionary.
So, your father...

1302
01:31:02,213 --> 01:31:05,424
- Yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah.
- What?

1303
01:31:05,508 --> 01:31:07,885
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

1304
01:31:07,968 --> 01:31:11,847
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

1305
01:31:13,683 --> 01:31:16,268
Jeffrey,
what are you talking about?

1306
01:31:17,937 --> 01:31:19,480
Jeffrey!

1307
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:21,649
Walter, if you're there,

1308
01:31:21,732 --> 01:31:24,110
pick up the fucking phone.
Come on.

1309
01:31:24,193 --> 01:31:26,904
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

1310
01:31:26,987 --> 01:31:28,364
'Dude?'

1311
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:32,243
I'm at my place. I need you
to come and pick me up.

1312
01:31:32,326 --> 01:31:34,829
'I can't drive, Dude,
it's Erev Shabbos.'

1313
01:31:34,912 --> 01:31:36,664
- What?
- 'Erev Shabbos.'

1314
01:31:36,747 --> 01:31:39,083
- 'I can't drive.'
- Man!

1315
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,836
'I'm not supposed
to pick up the phone

1316
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:44,672
- 'unless it's an emergency.'
- This is a fucking emergency!

1317
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:47,216
'That's why
I picked up the phone.'

1318
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:50,428
Walter, you fuck,
we gotta go to Pasadena.

1319
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:52,680
Pick me up
or I'm off the bowling team.

1320
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:11,907
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

1321
01:32:11,991 --> 01:32:14,702
Get out of that fucking car!

1322
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:17,288
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

1323
01:32:18,748 --> 01:32:20,958
Get out of the fucking...

1324
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,085
Who the fuck are you, man?

1325
01:32:23,169 --> 01:32:27,048
Easy, man. Relax, man.
No physical harm intended.

1326
01:32:27,131 --> 01:32:30,176
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me around?

1327
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:31,510
Come on, fuckhead.

1328
01:32:31,594 --> 01:32:33,804
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

1329
01:32:33,888 --> 01:32:36,182
Brother Seamus?

1330
01:32:36,265 --> 01:32:38,809
Like an Irish monk?

1331
01:32:38,893 --> 01:32:41,562
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1332
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:45,399
My name is Da Fino. I'm a
private snoop, like you, man.

1333
01:32:45,483 --> 01:32:48,361
- What?
- A dick, man.

1334
01:32:48,444 --> 01:32:51,822
Let me tell you something.
I dig your work.

1335
01:32:51,906 --> 01:32:53,866
Playing one side
against the other.

1336
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:56,410
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff.

1337
01:32:56,494 --> 01:32:57,953
I'm not! Fuck it.

1338
01:32:58,037 --> 01:33:00,790
Just stay away
from my lady friend.

1339
01:33:00,873 --> 01:33:03,376
I'm not messing
with your special lady.

1340
01:33:03,459 --> 01:33:05,336
She's not my special lady.

1341
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,505
I'm just helping her conceive.

1342
01:33:07,588 --> 01:33:10,007
- I'm not...
- Who are you working for?

1343
01:33:10,091 --> 01:33:13,511
Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?

1344
01:33:13,636 --> 01:33:15,388
The Knutsens.

1345
01:33:15,471 --> 01:33:19,767
The... who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

1346
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:23,354
The Knutsens.
It's a wandering-daughter job.

1347
01:33:24,313 --> 01:33:27,233
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1348
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:29,777
Her real name is Fawn Knutsen.

1349
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:33,114
Her parents want her back.

1350
01:33:33,197 --> 01:33:35,616
Jesus fucking Christ.

1351
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,868
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

1352
01:33:37,952 --> 01:33:41,747
The Knutsens told me to
show her this when I found her.

1353
01:33:41,831 --> 01:33:45,876
It's the family farm
outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.

1354
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,921
They think it'll
make her homesick.

1355
01:33:49,005 --> 01:33:53,259
How are you gonna keep 'em down
once they've seen Karl Hungus?

1356
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:56,012
- She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
- Oh, man.

1357
01:33:56,095 --> 01:33:58,014
Maybe not, but she's not around.

1358
01:33:58,097 --> 01:34:02,727
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

1359
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:06,897
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

1360
01:34:06,981 --> 01:34:09,108
Compeers, you know what I mean?

1361
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:11,360
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1362
01:34:11,444 --> 01:34:13,696
And stay away from my special...

1363
01:34:13,779 --> 01:34:16,615
from my fucking
lady friend, man.

1364
01:34:18,617 --> 01:34:21,203
Ze lingonberry pancakes.

1365
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:27,418
Lingonberry pancakes.

1366
01:34:31,088 --> 01:34:33,466
Sree pigs in blanket.

1367
01:34:39,555 --> 01:34:41,557
She has lingonberry pancakes.

1368
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,901
We totally fucked it up, man.

1369
01:34:51,984 --> 01:34:55,654
We fucked up his payoff,
we pissed off the kidnappers,

1370
01:34:55,738 --> 01:34:59,617
and Lebowski, he yelled at me
but he didn't do anything, huh?

1371
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:02,411
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic...

1372
01:35:02,495 --> 01:35:04,580
If he knows I'm a fuck-up,

1373
01:35:04,664 --> 01:35:07,583
why does he ask me
to get his wife back?

1374
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,211
Because he doesn't
want her back.

1375
01:35:10,294 --> 01:35:13,464
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

1376
01:35:13,547 --> 01:35:16,550
But then,
why doesn't he give a shit

1377
01:35:16,634 --> 01:35:18,469
about his million bucks?

1378
01:35:18,552 --> 01:35:21,555
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1379
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:23,391
but he never asked for it back.

1380
01:35:23,474 --> 01:35:26,769
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

1381
01:35:26,852 --> 01:35:30,189
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1382
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:33,401
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1383
01:35:33,484 --> 01:35:36,237
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1384
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,614
How does
this add up to an emergency?

1385
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:40,199
Huh?

1386
01:35:40,282 --> 01:35:42,868
I see what you're
getting at, Dude,

1387
01:35:42,952 --> 01:35:45,788
he kept the money.
My point is...

1388
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:50,543
here we are, it's Shabbos,
which I'm allowed to break

1389
01:35:50,626 --> 01:35:53,546
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

1390
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:55,965
Come off it.
You're not even fucking Jewish.

1391
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:58,509
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1392
01:35:58,592 --> 01:36:00,594
You're fucking Polish-Catholic.

1393
01:36:00,678 --> 01:36:03,097
I converted when I married
Cynthia. Come on.

1394
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,808
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know this.

1395
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:08,394
Five years ago,
you were divorced.

1396
01:36:08,477 --> 01:36:11,063
So when you get divorced,
you return your library card?

1397
01:36:11,147 --> 01:36:13,858
You get a new license?
You stop being Jewish?

1398
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:17,820
- This is the driveway.
- I'm Jewish as fucking Tevye.

1399
01:36:17,903 --> 01:36:21,574
Man, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

1400
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:25,536
Taking care of her fucking dog.
Going to her fucking synagogue.

1401
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:27,163
You're living in the past.

1402
01:36:27,246 --> 01:36:29,165
3,000 years
of beautiful tradition

1403
01:36:29,248 --> 01:36:31,125
from Moses to Sandy Koufax,

1404
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:36,088
damn right I'm living
in the fucking past! I... Jesus.

1405
01:36:36,172 --> 01:36:38,674
What the hell happened?

1406
01:36:58,569 --> 01:37:00,321
Where was she, man?

1407
01:37:00,404 --> 01:37:02,406
Visiting friends
in Palm Springs.

1408
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:04,700
She just left.
Never bothered to tell us.

1409
01:37:04,784 --> 01:37:07,536
I guess the nihilist
knew where she was.

1410
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,413
She never
even kidnapped herself.

1411
01:37:09,497 --> 01:37:13,459
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am I? A fucking veteran.

1412
01:37:13,542 --> 01:37:16,295
You shouldn't go in, Dude.
He's very angry.

1413
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:21,133
So, man...

1414
01:37:21,217 --> 01:37:24,762
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

1415
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:27,723
- Where's the fucking money?
- A million bucks

1416
01:37:27,807 --> 01:37:31,727
from fucking needy little
urban achievers! You are scum!

1417
01:37:31,811 --> 01:37:34,188
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am I?

1418
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:37,566
I'm the guy that's gonna kick
your goldbricking ass!

1419
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:41,362
The briefcase was empty.
You kept the money for yourself.

1420
01:37:41,445 --> 01:37:43,447
You have your story,
I have mine.

1421
01:37:43,531 --> 01:37:46,283
I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.

1422
01:37:46,367 --> 01:37:49,787
As if we would ever
take your bullshit money!

1423
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:53,541
You thought Bunny had been
kidnapped, and you were glad.

1424
01:37:53,624 --> 01:37:55,876
You could make
some money disappear.

1425
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:58,629
You needed was a sap
to pin it on.

1426
01:37:58,713 --> 01:38:02,591
You just met me.
You... human paraquat!

1427
01:38:02,675 --> 01:38:04,885
You figured,
"Oh, here's a loser."

1428
01:38:04,969 --> 01:38:08,305
Somebody the square community
won't give a shit about.

1429
01:38:08,389 --> 01:38:12,768
- Well, aren't you?
- Well, yeah, but...

1430
01:38:14,061 --> 01:38:15,521
Get out, both of you.

1431
01:38:15,604 --> 01:38:19,025
Look at that phony.
Pretending to be a millionaire.

1432
01:38:19,108 --> 01:38:21,027
Out of this house now, you bums!

1433
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:22,820
Let me tell you something.

1434
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:25,281
I've seen
a lot of spinals, Dude,

1435
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:28,868
and this guy's a fake.
A fucking goldbricker.

1436
01:38:28,951 --> 01:38:32,246
- Stay away from me!
- This guy fucking walks.

1437
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:35,291
- I've never been more certain.
- Stay away!

1438
01:38:35,374 --> 01:38:38,711
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man, he's a cripple.

1439
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:40,713
Get away from me!

1440
01:38:42,548 --> 01:38:45,843
- Put him down, man!
- Yeah, I'll put him down!

1441
01:38:45,926 --> 01:38:48,054
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

1442
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:07,490
Come on, help me
put him back in his chair.

1443
01:39:27,551 --> 01:39:29,929
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

1444
01:39:30,012 --> 01:39:32,723
Fighting in desert
is very different

1445
01:39:32,807 --> 01:39:36,894
from fighting in jungle.
'Nam was a foot soldier's war,

1446
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:41,065
whereas this thing should,
you know, be a piece of cake.

1447
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:44,985
I mean, I had an M16 Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1448
01:39:45,069 --> 01:39:47,488
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

1449
01:39:47,571 --> 01:39:50,324
- Yeah.
- That's fuckin' combat.

1450
01:39:50,408 --> 01:39:53,077
The man in
the black pajamas, Dude.

1451
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,579
Worthy fuckin' adversary.

1452
01:39:55,663 --> 01:39:59,208
- Who's in pajamas, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1453
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:01,252
Whereas, what we have here...

1454
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:03,796
Fig-eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

1455
01:40:03,879 --> 01:40:06,173
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1456
01:40:06,257 --> 01:40:08,551
- This... this is not a worthy...
- Hey!

1457
01:40:08,634 --> 01:40:10,970
What's this day-of-rest shit?

1458
01:40:11,053 --> 01:40:14,015
What's this bullshit?!
I don't fuckin' care!

1459
01:40:14,098 --> 01:40:17,768
It don't matter to Jesus.
But you not fooling me, man.

1460
01:40:17,852 --> 01:40:20,062
You might fool
the league office,

1461
01:40:20,146 --> 01:40:22,690
but you don't fool Jesus.

1462
01:40:22,773 --> 01:40:25,401
It's bush league
psyche-out stuff.

1463
01:40:25,484 --> 01:40:27,862
Laughable, man.

1464
01:40:27,945 --> 01:40:31,198
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1465
01:40:31,282 --> 01:40:35,286
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1466
01:40:35,369 --> 01:40:39,498
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

1467
01:40:43,002 --> 01:40:45,171
He's cracking.

1468
01:40:45,629 --> 01:40:47,173
The whole concept of Asia.

1469
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:49,508
Many learned men
have disputed this,

1470
01:40:49,592 --> 01:40:52,845
but in the 14th Century,
the Rabahm, he...

1471
01:41:01,604 --> 01:41:03,898
Well, they finally did it.

1472
01:41:03,981 --> 01:41:06,192
They killed my fucking car.

1473
01:41:06,275 --> 01:41:10,071
We want ze money, Lebowski.

1474
01:41:10,154 --> 01:41:12,406
Ja, otherwise, we kill ze girl.

1475
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:15,993
Ja, it seems you have
forgotten our little deal.

1476
01:41:16,077 --> 01:41:18,913
You don't have
the fucking girl, dipshit.

1477
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:21,666
We know you never did.

1478
01:41:21,749 --> 01:41:23,417
Are these the Nazis?

1479
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:25,711
No, nihilists.
Nothing to be afraid of.

1480
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:31,217
Ve don't care. Ve still
want the money, Lebowski,

1481
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:33,469
or we'll fuck you up.

1482
01:41:33,552 --> 01:41:36,263
Fuck you.
Fuck the three of yous.

1483
01:41:36,347 --> 01:41:39,975
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1484
01:41:40,059 --> 01:41:43,270
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1485
01:41:43,354 --> 01:41:45,606
His girlfriend gave up her toe.

1486
01:41:45,690 --> 01:41:48,317
She zought
we'd be getting $1 million.

1487
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,652
It's not fair.

1488
01:41:49,735 --> 01:41:52,822
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here,

1489
01:41:52,905 --> 01:41:54,991
you bunch of fucking crybabies.

1490
01:41:55,074 --> 01:41:59,161
Cool it, Walter. Hey, look, pal,
there never was any money.

1491
01:41:59,245 --> 01:42:01,580
The big Lebowski
gave me an empty briefcase,

1492
01:42:01,664 --> 01:42:03,499
so take it up with him, man.

1493
01:42:03,582 --> 01:42:06,002
I would like my undies back.

1494
01:42:06,085 --> 01:42:09,338
- Are these guys gonna hurt us?
- No, these men are cowards.

1495
01:42:09,422 --> 01:42:12,758
OK, so we take
ze money you have on you

1496
01:42:12,842 --> 01:42:14,802
and we calls it even.

1497
01:42:15,594 --> 01:42:17,430
Fuck you.

1498
01:42:17,513 --> 01:42:20,975
No, Walter, come on.
We're ending this cheap, man.

1499
01:42:21,058 --> 01:42:23,936
- No, what's mine is mine.
- Come on, Walter.

1500
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:28,107
- No funny stuff.
- All right, I got...

1501
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:31,152
- uh, 4 bucks, almost 5.
- I got $18.

1502
01:42:31,235 --> 01:42:33,237
What's mine is mine.

1503
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:35,948
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.

1504
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:38,451
Come and get it.

1505
01:42:39,076 --> 01:42:41,370
We fuck you up.

1506
01:42:41,454 --> 01:42:43,414
Show me what you got, nihilist.

1507
01:42:43,497 --> 01:42:44,999
I fuck you.

1508
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:46,667
Come on, he's got a sword.

1509
01:42:46,751 --> 01:42:48,586
Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

1510
01:42:48,669 --> 01:42:51,881
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1511
01:42:51,964 --> 01:42:53,591
I fuck you, I!

1512
01:42:58,929 --> 01:43:01,015
Take it easy, man.
Here's the $4.

1513
01:43:07,396 --> 01:43:09,398
I got a fucking ball, man.

1514
01:43:15,112 --> 01:43:17,239
Anti-Semite!

1515
01:43:17,323 --> 01:43:19,492
I fuck you in ze ass.

1516
01:43:19,575 --> 01:43:23,079
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1517
01:43:23,162 --> 01:43:24,789
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1518
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:33,381
We got a man down, Dude.

1519
01:43:36,801 --> 01:43:39,011
God, they shot him, man.

1520
01:43:39,095 --> 01:43:41,055
- No, Dude.
- They shot Donny?

1521
01:43:41,138 --> 01:43:44,308
There weren't any shots fired.
It's a heart attack.

1522
01:43:44,392 --> 01:43:46,769
Call the medics, Dude.

1523
01:43:46,852 --> 01:43:50,398
I'd go myself, but I'm
pumping blood. Might pass out.

1524
01:43:50,481 --> 01:43:54,110
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

1525
01:43:54,193 --> 01:43:56,362
We got help choppering in.

1526
01:44:23,097 --> 01:44:25,891
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

1527
01:44:25,975 --> 01:44:27,810
Yeah, man.

1528
01:44:27,893 --> 01:44:29,937
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

1529
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:31,564
Jeff Lebowski.

1530
01:44:31,647 --> 01:44:33,232
Walter Sobchak.

1531
01:44:33,315 --> 01:44:35,985
The Dude, actually, is, uh...

1532
01:44:36,068 --> 01:44:38,696
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

1533
01:44:38,779 --> 01:44:44,493
Yes, I understand
you're taking away the remains.

1534
01:44:44,577 --> 01:44:46,120
Yeah.

1535
01:44:46,203 --> 01:44:48,706
We have the urn.

1536
01:44:48,789 --> 01:44:52,126
I assume this is credit card.

1537
01:44:53,252 --> 01:44:54,712
Yeah.

1538
01:45:08,934 --> 01:45:11,228
What's this?

1539
01:45:11,312 --> 01:45:13,189
That's for the urn.

1540
01:45:13,272 --> 01:45:15,691
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

1541
01:45:15,775 --> 01:45:17,818
Yes, so we were informed.

1542
01:45:17,902 --> 01:45:20,279
However, we must, of course,

1543
01:45:20,363 --> 01:45:23,574
transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.

1544
01:45:24,909 --> 01:45:26,911
This is $180.

1545
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:30,915
It is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

1546
01:45:30,998 --> 01:45:33,459
- Can we just, uh...
- $180?

1547
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:37,505
- They range up to 3,000.
- Uh, we're, uh, ahem...

1548
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:39,715
Can't we just
rent it from you?

1549
01:45:39,799 --> 01:45:42,551
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

1550
01:45:42,635 --> 01:45:44,178
We're scattering the ashes!

1551
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:47,348
Just because we're bereaved,
doesn't make us saps!

1552
01:45:47,431 --> 01:45:50,184
Sir, please, lower your voices.

1553
01:45:50,267 --> 01:45:52,311
Man, don't you have, you know,

1554
01:45:52,395 --> 01:45:56,148
something else we could
put him in, you know?

1555
01:45:56,232 --> 01:45:58,818
That is our most...
modestly priced receptacle.

1556
01:45:58,901 --> 01:46:00,444
Goddamn it!

1557
01:46:02,196 --> 01:46:04,407
Is there a Ralph's around here?

1558
01:46:31,058 --> 01:46:34,770
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1559
01:46:34,854 --> 01:46:37,148
He was one of us.

1560
01:46:37,231 --> 01:46:41,569
He was a man who loved
the outdoors... and bowling.

1561
01:46:41,652 --> 01:46:43,904
As a surfer,
he explored the beaches

1562
01:46:43,988 --> 01:46:45,865
of Southern California,

1563
01:46:45,948 --> 01:46:51,162
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo
and up to Pismo.

1564
01:46:51,245 --> 01:46:56,167
He died... he died as so
many men of his generation,

1565
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:58,044
before his time.

1566
01:46:58,127 --> 01:47:01,255
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

1567
01:47:01,339 --> 01:47:04,842
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

1568
01:47:04,925 --> 01:47:10,348
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,
and Hill 364.

1569
01:47:10,431 --> 01:47:12,808
These young men
gave their lives.

1570
01:47:12,892 --> 01:47:15,102
So did Donny.

1571
01:47:16,854 --> 01:47:19,857
Donny who loved bowling.

1572
01:47:21,525 --> 01:47:24,111
And so...

1573
01:47:24,195 --> 01:47:27,073
Theodore Donald Karabotsos,

1574
01:47:27,156 --> 01:47:31,869
in accordance
with what we think

1575
01:47:31,952 --> 01:47:34,288
your dying wishes
might well have been,

1576
01:47:34,372 --> 01:47:38,250
we commit your final,
mortal remains

1577
01:47:38,334 --> 01:47:42,213
to the bosom
of the Pacific Ocean,

1578
01:47:42,296 --> 01:47:45,174
which you loved so well.

1579
01:47:46,967 --> 01:47:48,928
Goodnight, sweet prince.

1580
01:48:03,192 --> 01:48:05,403
Shit.

1581
01:48:07,196 --> 01:48:10,157
Oh, shit, Dude, I'm sorry.

1582
01:48:10,866 --> 01:48:14,412
- Goddamn wind.
- Goddamn it, Walter.

1583
01:48:14,495 --> 01:48:16,914
- You fucking asshole!
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1584
01:48:16,998 --> 01:48:19,458
Everything's
a fucking travesty with you.

1585
01:48:19,542 --> 01:48:21,252
Sorry. It was an accident.

1586
01:48:21,335 --> 01:48:23,087
What was that shit
about Vietnam?

1587
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:26,549
What does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

1588
01:48:26,632 --> 01:48:28,467
What the fuck
were you talking about?

1589
01:48:28,551 --> 01:48:30,511
Dude, I'm sorry.

1590
01:48:32,388 --> 01:48:34,640
Fuckin'...

1591
01:48:40,271 --> 01:48:42,523
Fuck, Walter.

1592
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:48,029
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

1593
01:48:51,741 --> 01:48:54,285
Let's go bowling.

1594
01:49:47,797 --> 01:49:49,757
Two oat sodas, Gary.

1595
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,301
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

1596
01:49:52,385 --> 01:49:54,637
I'm sorry to hear about Donny.

1597
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:58,099
Oh, well, yeah, you know,

1598
01:49:58,182 --> 01:50:01,644
sometimes you eat the bar
and sometimes, you know...

1599
01:50:01,727 --> 01:50:03,646
Hey, man!

1600
01:50:03,729 --> 01:50:05,690
Howdy doo, Dude.

1601
01:50:05,773 --> 01:50:08,234
I wondered if I'd see you again.

1602
01:50:08,317 --> 01:50:11,737
I wouldn't miss the semis.
How have things been going?

1603
01:50:11,821 --> 01:50:14,740
Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

1604
01:50:14,824 --> 01:50:18,244
- Sure. I gotcha.
- Yeah.

1605
01:50:18,327 --> 01:50:20,246
Thanks, Gary.

1606
01:50:20,329 --> 01:50:22,999
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1607
01:50:23,082 --> 01:50:25,710
- Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
- Oh, yeah.

1608
01:50:25,793 --> 01:50:27,878
I know that you will.

1609
01:50:27,962 --> 01:50:31,966
Yeah, well, the Dude abides.

1610
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:40,808
The Dude abides.

1611
01:50:43,602 --> 01:50:48,274
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1612
01:50:48,357 --> 01:50:52,361
It's good knowing
he's out there, the Dude.

1613
01:50:52,445 --> 01:50:55,531
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

1614
01:50:55,614 --> 01:50:57,783
Shoosh.

1615
01:50:57,867 --> 01:51:01,162
I sure hope he makes the finals.

1616
01:51:01,245 --> 01:51:06,000
Well, that about does her.
Wraps her all up.

1617
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:10,921
Things seem to have worked out
good for the Dude and Walter.

1618
01:51:11,005 --> 01:51:14,717
It was a pretty good story,
don't you think?

1619
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,887
Made me laugh to beat the band.

1620
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:20,264
Parts, anyway.

1621
01:51:20,348 --> 01:51:23,768
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1622
01:51:23,851 --> 01:51:26,520
But then I happen to know

1623
01:51:26,604 --> 01:51:30,107
that there's
a little Lebowski on the way.

1624
01:51:30,191 --> 01:51:34,028
I guess that's how
the whole darn human comedy

1625
01:51:34,111 --> 01:51:37,198
keeps perpetuating itself

1626
01:51:37,281 --> 01:51:40,076
down through the generations.

1627
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,161
Westward the wagons,

1628
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:45,331
across the sands
of time until we...

1629
01:51:45,414 --> 01:51:47,458
Oh, look at me.

1630
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:50,252
I'm ramblin' again.

1631
01:51:50,336 --> 01:51:53,005
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1632
01:51:53,089 --> 01:51:56,092
Catch ya later on
down the trail.

1633
01:51:56,175 --> 01:52:00,513
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good Sarsaparilla?
