00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,702
Over here! Help!

3
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,496
Quick, hurry!

4
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,790
Hurry up! This way!

5
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:41,750
Hurry!

6
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,968
- Ma'am. Ma'am?
- What's wrong with her?

7
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,302
We don't know yet, son.

8
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,222
Pinpoint pupils.

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,557
Do you know what kind of drugs
she was taking?

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,351
- Resp in the toilet. You wanna intubate?
- No, let's bag her first.

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,025
Go ahead. Give it to her.

12
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,654
Is she dead?

13
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,269
Hey, Eddie, you got any Oxy?

14
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,647
No Oxy. Got some H, though.

15
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,650
- I don't want that shit.
- Well, suit yourself.

16
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,905
Wait.

17
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,250
Fly safe.

18
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,854
Eddie, what's up?

19
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,690
- Hey, man.
- Wanna hit it?

20
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,607
Nah, I'm good, man.

21
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,567
- How much?
- Half-load.

22
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,879
- Ooh! Business been good.
- Fuck, yeah.

23
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,298
- What you do with your profits?
- Shit, I don't know, man.

24
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,510
- Spending it.
- You smart, you get in the market.

25
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,595
I got a broker. I can hook you up.

26
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,806
- No, I think I'm good, man.
- You sure?

27
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,183
- Yeah, dude. I gotta run. Marco.
- Hey.

28
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,198
- Fuck, yeah.
- What?

29
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,825
My broker told me
to short Weight Watchers,

30
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,286
and it just went down 12%.

31
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,579
You got a broker?

32
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,831
You gotta clean your money somehow, man.

33
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,709
- Hey, look, I'll send you his email.
- Okay.

34
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,400
Yeah, baby!

35
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,818
- It's party time!
- Hit it!

36
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,593
Morning, ladies.

37
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,013
- We ready?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,182
Looking good.

39
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,851
Call the Mexicans.

40
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,429
Enlighten my eyes...

41
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,600
or I shall sleep the sleep of death.

42
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,411
Hey, Zeke.

43
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,955
Want some eggs?

44
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,208
Hey.

45
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,627
Marty.

46
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,796
No, thank you.

47
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,258
Some coffee would be great,
though, please.

48
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,971
How long is he staying with us?

49
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,515
Just until they can find
a suitable home for him.

50
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,730
So, people just give us
babies indefinitely?

51
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,650
- What, like we're such the model family?
- Okay.

52
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,277
Easy on the sarcasm. We told you.

53
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,613
Mason asked us to help him out.

54
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,205
Where you goin'?

55
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,332
Wyatt's.

56
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,502
I thought Ruth told you
to stay away from him.

57
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,711
I don't care.

58
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,256
In case you've forgotten, it was Wyatt
that got expelled for protecting Jonah.

59
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,509
- That's not our fault.
- Bullshit.

60
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,594
- Hey.
- Jonah didn't get expelled.

61
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,764
They threw out Wyatt
because he's a Langmore.

62
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,183
I suppose you think that that's fair.

63
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,477
Well, none of it's fair.

64
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,651
Jonah, would you take the baby
in the other room?

65
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,735
I wanna talk to your father.

66
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,279
Come on, buddy.

67
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,240
Did you get any sleep?

68
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,368
She's right about Wyatt, you know?

69
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,163
Well, we have other problems.

70
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,750
Beecher's report to the commission.

71
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,169
It's as bad as we expected.

72
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,759
Marty, we've gotta get ahead of this,

73
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,178
or else the casino's
gonna go down in flames.

74
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,265
What do you wanna do?

75
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,102
Wilkes isn't returning my calls.

76
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,824
You know, I used to think
that we were, uh, different than them.

77
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,785
You know, these people that we work for.

78
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,372
And, um...

79
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,375
Hey.

80
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,919
We are different from them.

81
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,922
You saved my life.

82
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,800
Mason would've killed me otherwise.

83
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,845
And you are the one who has always said,

84
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,598
"People make choices."

85
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,477
Mason's wife didn't have a choice.

86
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,812
Our kids, they didn't have a choice.

87
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,733
Okay, well, we have to concentrate
on the casino.

88
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,779
So, I am going to go see Wilkes.

89
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,739
- Hello.
- Can you look after the baby

90
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,782
while I'm gone?

91
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,871
Jesus, is she dead?

92
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,624
I'll be right there.

93
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,918
What?

94
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,253
Rachel OD'd.

95
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,673
I gotta go.

96
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,356
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did.

97
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,360
I know you didn't sign up for this.
It's all been a nightmare.

98
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,613
Pretty weird kidnapping
when the victim gets to keep the ransom.

99
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,533
He gave it to us.

100
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,577
He was going on the run, and he knew
he couldn't take care of the baby.

101
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,872
I have no idea whether
to believe you or not.

102
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,834
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Yeah.

103
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,172
Have you heard about the Beecher letter?

104
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,799
Oh, yeah, I heard about it.

105
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,218
The casino's doomed.

106
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,637
The commission will never approve it.

107
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,765
- Unless you interceded.
- Yeah.

108
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,518
Nope, can't do it.

109
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,232
- Can't or won't?
- It's too late.

110
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,572
What about your offer?
Is it still on the table?

111
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,282
- Come on, Wendy.
- No, I'm serious.

112
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,784
You would leave Marty?

113
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,078
If it kept him safe. Him and the kids.

114
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,790
You said you'd do anything
to get that final vote on the casino.

115
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,293
I always wondered if you were lying.

116
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,212
Try me.

117
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,051
It's gone too far.

118
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,419
Are you wearing a wire?

119
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,422
Fuck you.

120
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,467
The EMTs took it off me.

121
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,219
Okay.

122
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,102
I didn't know you were using.

123
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah, well, it's not your problem.

124
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,401
I'm not a fucking junkie,
so don't worry about it.

125
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,239
Nix said that he thought
that the dope was spiked.

126
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,327
So?

127
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,705
So, it's not your fault, okay?

128
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,290
None of it is.

129
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,379
I'm really sorry
that I got you involved in all of this.

130
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,427
Yeah, well, no offense, Marty,
but that don't really mean shit.

131
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,056
You're right.

132
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,775
You know, when I first came-to,
I was relieved.

133
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,026
I was like...

134
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,655
"Well, that's good. I didn't die."

135
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,741
Then I was like...

136
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,872
"What the fuck now?"

137
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,875
Hey.

138
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,463
What if I can get you out?

139
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,466
The cartel doesn't know about you.

140
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,890
I don't know. I'm just really tired.

141
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,143
I know. I know.

142
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,023
Then let me help.

143
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,235
I can't fuck it up any worse.

144
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,375
That's the hearse Wendy was driving in.

145
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,713
They could've moved that dough anywhere.

146
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,054
You think you can handle
that Keebler Elf-looking motherfucker?

147
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,931
Only one way to find out.

148
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,067
- Hi, Harry.
- Ruth, hi.

149
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,069
You here for the invoices?

150
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,404
No, I actually need to talk to you
about something.

151
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,615
Come on in.

152
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,702
Um, it's kind of weird.

153
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
Weird?

154
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,255
Well, confidential-like.

155
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,549
Oh. Do tell.

156
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,095
Do you like what you do, Harry?

157
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,973
I never wanted to be anything else. Why?

158
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,683
Well...

159
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,978
you know, I work in the strip club, and...

160
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,232
I've just been thinking
about job security.

161
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,445
I mean, that's not something
I really wanna do for the rest of my life.

162
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,031
Not like what you do.

163
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,826
Well, that's the thing about our business.

164
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,661
You never run out of customers.

165
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,500
To tell the truth,
not everyone has the stomach for it.

166
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,544
I got a pretty strong fucking stomach.

167
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,340
Pardon my French.

168
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,008
Why don't you come back with me?

169
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,094
I'll show you what we do. Come on.

170
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,597
What's the line?

171
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,434
Eagles and three?

172
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,186
No, fuck the spread.

173
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,813
I told you before,
I'll tell you again, man.

174
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,106
They just a fluke.

175
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,442
Yeah, let me get three large
on the Browns.

176
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,402
FBI! Everybody down!

177
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,238
Don't move!
Don't move! Don't move!

178
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,876
- Hands! Freeze! Drop it!
- Put your hands up.

179
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:05,548
The latest update is 22 fatalities,
seven more in critical condition.

180
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,717
Fentanyl mixed with heroin.

181
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,929
Upstairs is getting their asses kicked.

182
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,266
No one cared as long as the minority
communities were the ones dying,

183
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,602
but once it hit Northwestern...

184
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,728
Do we have a source yet?

185
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,439
We're rolling up as many
mid-level and street dealers as we can.

186
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,067
The ODs seem to be limited
to the Navarro Cartel's territory.

187
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,570
With all due respect,
it doesn't sound like Navarro.

188
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,781
For all you who haven't had the pleasure,
this is Agent Petty.

189
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,286
He's been undercover down in Lake Ozark
for the past few months,

190
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,331
that is, until one of his informants
blew his cover.

191
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,376
Our theory is they're amping the dope
with fentanyl.

192
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,170
Maybe they overdid it.

193
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,673
Got a better idea?

194
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,134
Look at it epidemiologically.

195
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,470
If the tainted drugs were
from the Navarro Cartel,

196
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,807
we'd see a spike in ODs in Chicago,
Milwaukee, Detroit,

197
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,977
Cleveland and Indianapolis,
because Chicago's the hub.

198
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,563
But right now, we have a spike in ODs
in only two places:

199
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,233
Chicago and the Ozarks,
which indicates two things.

200
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,694
The contaminated drugs are a small batch,

201
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,739
and the drugs came
from the Ozarks to Chicago.

202
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,741
Okay.

203
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,868
Find the connection.

204
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,581
You can tell a lot
about a guest...

205
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,918
I call them guests.
When you're working on them.

206
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,338
Did they drink? Were they fit?

207
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,799
I can even tell you their station in life.

208
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,884
Like this guy.

209
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,220
Had his teeth straightened.

210
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,722
Family probably had money.

211
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,606
Oh, my God.

212
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,692
The smell of formaldehyde.

213
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,990
The funny thing is people are scared
of the dead, and they shouldn't be.

214
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,783
It's the living who can hurt you.

215
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,203
- We don't do that.
- Sorry.

216
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,544
Is there a bathroom I can use?

217
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,548
Stomach not as strong as
you thought?

218
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,133
Come on. I'll show you.

219
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,679
What's in here?

220
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,724
That's a storage room.
Just some surplus caskets.

221
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,059
Bathroom's just down the hall.

222
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,401
I appreciate you bailing me out,
Ms. Pierce.

223
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,819
I'll pay you back every penny

224
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,821
just as soon as
we get back up and rolling.

225
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,531
I know you will, Amos.

226
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,702
I don't know what happened, man.
It seemed like the feds was everywhere.

227
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,622
Come on. We'll give you a ride home.

228
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,375
I really appreciate it,
but, uh, I can just catch me an Uber.

229
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,003
It's no problem. It's on our way.

230
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,178
You can't save the world, Marty.

231
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,429
I'm not trying to.

232
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:03,017
I told Rachel that I'm gonna help her
get out from under Petty.

233
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,063
Jesus.

234
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,317
- How are you gonna do that?
- I don't know yet.

235
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,740
You're a good man, Marty. You are.

236
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:21,827
But right now,

237
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,955
we need to get the casino over the hump,
and then we can make things right.

238
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,875
She almost died because of what we did.

239
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,713
Rachel almost died
because she's a drug addict.

240
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,175
She stole from us. She informed on us.

241
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,387
She wore a wire.
At what point is any of that our fault?

242
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,977
Is there something I need to know
about you and Rachel?

243
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,273
Mom, Dad.

244
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,360
Sheriff Nix, this is a surprise.

245
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,487
Mrs. Byrde. Marty.

246
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,698
I'm sorry to stop by so late,

247
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,909
but I needed to ask you some questions
about Mason Young.

248
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,370
Thank you, Charlotte.

249
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,872
Can I get you some coffee?
Or maybe some tea, or...

250
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,332
No, I won't be long.

251
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,210
Social services is looking for Mason.

252
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,838
It seems like he's disappeared.

253
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,758
- Oh, dear.
- Disappeared, huh?

254
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,720
He hasn't answered his phone,
and no one's seen him.

255
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,889
So, I thought I would check with you,
see if you knew anything.

256
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:30,730
Well, we were contacted
by social services about the baby,

257
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,150
but we actually hadn't spoken
to Mason in months.

258
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,028
See, it just seems a hair strange
that you end up with his child,

259
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,530
and then he goes missing.

260
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,783
Yeah, well, uh...

261
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,913
Actually, I think
it was probably the reverse.

262
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,749
He must've gone missing

263
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,668
after social services took the baby
into custody.

264
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,920
So, you think he might've
done himself some harm?

265
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,717
We know how much he loved that baby.

266
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,510
- Yeah.
- Which is why we wanted to get the boy

267
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,513
out of the system as quickly as possible.
We've been waiting to hear from Mason.

268
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,265
You didn't try to reach him?

269
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,101
We went up to Jeff City looking for him,
but he wasn't on his regular corner.

270
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,227
Mm-hmm.

271
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,771
Why not just call him?

272
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,025
We didn't have his new number.

273
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,860
Hmm.

274
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,362
You know...

275
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,325
you might wanna talk to the Snells.

276
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,496
You know they have a relationship.

277
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,960
Yeah, I may have to do that.

278
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,383
You know, the Snells and I,
we go back a long way.

279
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,969
But everything has its limit.

280
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,059
Thank you for your time.

281
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,394
You'll let me know if you hear from Mason?

282
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,439
- Of course.
- All right. Good night now.

283
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,496
Why are you asking me this?

284
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,164
I don't know, Amos.

285
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,667
Maybe because most of the ODs were
on your turf.

286
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,838
I don't know nothing about it. Any of it.

287
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,548
You cut our heroin with fentanyl.

288
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:24,009
You tampered with our product,
and now people are dying.

289
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,512
I didn't. I wouldn't!

290
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,193
We don't wanna do this.

291
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,780
But we are going to find out,
one way or another.

292
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,074
Make it easy on yourself.

293
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,577
- What did you do to the drugs?
- Nothing.

294
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,414
There's still some hidden
in the body shop.

295
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,542
It's wrapped in that plastic.
That's the way it came.

296
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,055
Okay.

297
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,060
I lost money on the market,
so I hit the dope.

298
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,563
But only with inert stuff.

299
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,356
Fentanyl?

300
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,568
No fucking way, I swear to God.

301
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,362
I only used B12,
and who's that gonna hurt, huh?

302
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,996
I appreciate your honesty, Amos.

303
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,999
And don't worry. It's all over now.

304
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,557
I saw Susan Blake today.

305
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,769
Her husband kept a file on Wilkes.

306
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,729
He's over-leveraged.

307
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,900
He's using his charity
as his own personal account.

308
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,569
Now, I have a plan, but I need your help.

309
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,991
Did you hear me?

310
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,250
I wanted to tell Nix the truth
about Mason,

311
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,670
just to get it over with.

312
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,676
That would have been a very bad idea.

313
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,142
Well, I didn't say I was going to.
I just wanted to.

314
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,772
So, why are we here, Marty?

315
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:31,238
EMTs found a wire on Rachel.

316
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,782
I know she was working with you.

317
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,868
And?

318
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,245
She's worthless to you now.

319
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,583
It's kind of touching,
the way you care about her.

320
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,294
I mean, she was trying to put you away.

321
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,962
She almost died last night.

322
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,382
I'm asking you as a human being
to let her go.

323
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,304
You work for one of the most
vicious cartels in the world,

324
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,598
and you're talking to me
about being human?

325
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,725
Rachel isn't a criminal.

326
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,062
Does your wife know
about your feelings for Rachel?

327
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,941
Do your superiors know
that you were supplying drugs to Rachel?

328
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,614
Just so we're clear, the drugs she OD'd on
came from your business partners.

329
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,827
But I might be willing
to let her off the hook, if...

330
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:19,787
If?

331
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,706
I want the Snells' operation.

332
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,377
The Snells are our partners in the casino.
I'm not aware of an operation.

333
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,714
We think the Snells poisoned
the cartel's dope.

334
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,843
Maybe this marriage of convenience
became inconvenient.

335
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,096
But once the cartel figures it out,

336
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,348
it doesn't bode well
for their partnership.

337
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,560
So... if you really care about Rachel,

338
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,064
you're gonna have to choose sides, Marty.

339
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,036
What are you doing down here?

340
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,997
I like it here.

341
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,419
- Is the baby asleep?
- Finally.

342
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,590
Is that homework?

343
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,139
- Do you know what gamer currency is?
- Mnh-mnh.

344
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,225
Cyber criminals use it to launder money.

345
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,186
I could do this.

346
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,650
We're not looking to get into more crime,
sweetheart. We're trying to get out of it.

347
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,492
But let me ask you a question.

348
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,330
The account you were using,
Mike Fleming's...

349
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,793
How did you open that
without an adult's permission?

350
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,923
Well, I looked into some local banks,

351
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:59,303
and there was one small one
that failed the stress test a few times.

352
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,180
Not enough capital,

353
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,724
so I figured they wouldn't look
too closely into a kid's account.

354
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,812
So, hypothetically speaking, um...

355
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,816
I mean, would it be possible to open
an offshore account with that?

356
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,320
- You wanna launder money through it?
- No. No, no, no. No, of course not.

357
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,238
I'm just wondering if it's possible.

358
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,825
I've already done it, Mom.

359
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:26,914
So, if I wanted to disguise the source
of some funds...

360
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,916
I can do it.

361
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,130
Just this once.

362
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,845
You going somewhere?

363
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,476
Yeah, I'm going home.

364
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,436
I'll give you a ride.

365
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,272
I'll take a cab.

366
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,860
You outed yourself to Marty, didn't you?

367
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,074
You really think he's gonna rescue you?

368
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,827
Maybe he will.

369
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,415
You're not going home.

370
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:16,838
You're being detained until I can
extradite you back to Louisiana, so...

371
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,553
You still belong to me.

372
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,564
Hi. I didn't know you had a key.

373
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,566
We don't.

374
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,989
You should've called.
I would've met you here.

375
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,826
No need.
I just wanted to talk about the accounts.

376
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,328
I send you statements.

377
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,749
Hmm. We're kinda like the US government.
Trust, but verify.

378
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,005
Like this $1.8 million withdrawal
from the construction account made today

379
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,339
caught my attention.

380
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,758
Um...

381
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,886
Right. Yeah, $1.8.

382
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,765
That seems a little odd.
We haven't started building yet.

383
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,185
We have infrastructure costs.

384
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,647
Gas and water and power.
We gotta get it all up there.

385
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,359
And, uh, we, uh... We took out a loan
to get things rolling.

386
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,777
Today was the due date.

387
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,032
Okay.

388
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:33,290
I just don't want you
to confuse our money with yours.

389
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:39,254
So from now on, all expenditures
over $50,000 get run by me.

390
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,133
Okay.

391
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,970
Uh... understood.

392
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,639
Anything else?

393
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,310
- The Snells.
- What about them?

394
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,604
They spiked our dope with fentanyl.

395
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,232
The feds are up our asses.
My client is furious with them.

396
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,276
And?

397
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,862
The cartel's gonna do
what the cartel does.

398
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,073
The casino is on their land.

399
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,909
The casino is gonna get built,
with or without them.

400
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,162
- Helen, that's gonna be a huge problem.
- Your problem, Marty.

401
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,540
I'm an accountant. I move numbers around.

402
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,793
I'm a lawyer. I move words around.

403
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,255
There are no victims here.
Just volunteers, right?

404
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,147
<i>Following a teacher walkout
that began ten days ago,</i>

405
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,692
<i>state lawmakers finally passed
a new education budget bill</i>

406
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,738
<i>providing, on average,
a $3,000 raise for teachers statewide.</i>

407
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:51,076
<i>The strike ends amid a wave
of teacher protests throughout the state,</i>

408
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,161
<i>as reduced education...</i>

409
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,999
I tried reaching you. I made dinner.

410
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,337
Helen Pierce, um, was curious today

411
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,800
as to why $1.8 million was missing
from the construction account.

412
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,969
I was gonna tell you when you got home.

413
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,262
Okay, I'm home.

414
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,558
I had to put something in motion
on Wilkes. I had to move fast.

415
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,563
Did it not occur to you
to ask me first, Wendy?

416
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,440
I did.

417
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,443
I asked for your help.
You were more interested in Rachel.

418
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,778
Okay, that ground
feels a little shaky to me.

419
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,405
Look, we're gonna get most
of the money back,

420
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,322
if that's what you're worried about.

421
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,408
Do you not know
what happens to people who skim?

422
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,661
This is not skimming.

423
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,496
This is me trying to make sure

424
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,957
that we build a fucking casino
for the fucking cartel,

425
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,459
so that we all don't get killed.

426
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,211
Now, you wanna second-guess me,
go right ahead.

427
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,797
What I want is to not be blindsided...

428
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,133
...by having $1.8 million

429
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,302
just mysteriously disappear.

430
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,219
You know what?

431
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,723
Since Mason, your priorities have been
completely upside down.

432
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,101
Well, you seem completely unaffected
by what happened. How about that?

433
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,645
I'm the one he kidnapped!

434
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:06,359
I'm the one who he threatened to kill,
so don't you fucking tell me what I feel.

435
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,488
Do you know what? Just...

436
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,573
You take care of the baby.
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

437
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,334
Is something bothering you?

438
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,921
As a matter of fact, there is.

439
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,383
Should I make you some cocoa?

440
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,052
It was you, wasn't it?

441
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,847
You spiked the product.

442
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,935
What if I did?

443
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,397
You know how many people you've hurt?

444
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,607
Ugh!

445
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,237
Some junkies who were killing themselves
with dope succeeded.

446
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,406
So what? This is about respect.

447
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,536
The cartel thought
they could roll right over us.

448
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,621
Well, they don't anymore.

449
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,832
I think you misconstrue the situation.

450
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,462
I told you not to get involved with them.

451
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,631
I don't answer to you, Darlene.

452
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,138
I think you misconstrue the situation.

453
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,848
They'll come after us.

454
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,977
There'll be a war.

455
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,062
We've had to fight before.

456
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,523
I am not afraid. Are you?

457
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,193
Yes, I am. I am afraid.

458
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,363
Of you...

459
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,908
and your implacable rage.

460
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,411
Your rashness.

461
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:43,415
You killed Ash...

462
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,251
for no reason.

463
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,088
For money, for a casino.

464
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,966
I killed him to save you.

465
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,179
I guess we just see things differently.

466
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:34,549
Hey.

467
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,055
You okay?

468
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,100
Morning.

469
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,291
Hello, Ruth.

470
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,252
What the fuck is it now?
You already kicked out Wyatt.

471
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,254
- Please sit down.
- You kicking out Three, too?

472
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,882
- What, you get a family rate?
- I guess they didn't tell you.

473
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,842
This school has had it in
for the Langmores

474
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,178
- since my daddy's been here.
- This has nothing to do with Three.

475
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,430
Wyatt is a good kid.

476
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,476
Did you even read his application essay
for Mizzou?

477
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,103
He's smart.

478
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,231
He ain't like the rest of us.
I mean, he can go somewhere.

479
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,899
We're letting him back in, Ruth.

480
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,568
What?

481
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:39,280
Assuming there are no further incidents,
we're rescinding the expulsion.

482
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,785
A benefactor made a very eloquent case
on his behalf.

483
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,330
- Who?
- Well, I can't tell you.

484
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,249
He prefers it that way.

485
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,336
Make sure Wyatt's back on Monday.

486
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,173
Okay.

487
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,229
Hey, boss.

488
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,731
What's up?

489
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,692
Well, some interesting news.

490
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,655
Looks like the right-to-work initiative's
gonna make it on the ballot.

491
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,157
Mmm! About time.

492
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,993
And a lot of pushback from the unions,
big surprise.

493
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:30,582
And a $1.8 million donation was made
to the foundation.

494
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,793
- That's generous.
- Yeah, with some strings.

495
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,463
Half goes to the Wilkes Foundation,

496
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,799
a third passes through
to the Blake Foundation,

497
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,927
and the rest goes
to some hurricane victims charity.

498
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,679
600K to Blake?

499
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,017
- That's close to the amount we owe them.
- I know.

500
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,311
- It smells a little.
- Who's the donor?

501
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,231
- It's an anonymous gift.
- That's even worse.

502
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,568
Before you accept it,

503
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,695
you better find out
who the hell anonymous is.

504
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,738
Yeah.

505
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,366
Whoa!
They've got a ton of first editions.

506
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,285
<i>Look Homeward, Angel.</i>

507
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,455
That's, like, probably
my favorite American novel ever.

508
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,422
Excuse me.
Could you unlock that case for me? Thanks.

509
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:29,849
Just be careful. These are worth a lot.

510
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,226
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

511
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,227
You're welcome.

512
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,396
Wow!

513
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,486
Thomas Wolfe, huge guy. Like, 6'6".

514
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,446
But he liked to write standing up.

515
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,492
So, he would stand at his refrigerator
and use it as a desk.

516
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,161
Crazy.

517
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,627
Ruth, what's up?

518
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,505
Yeah.

519
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,967
Okay, what's that mean?

520
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,223
Okay.

521
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,560
Did she tell you who?

522
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,730
All right. Love you. Bye.

523
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,069
I got back into school.

524
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,696
- What?
- Yeah.

525
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,322
Well, that's cool.

526
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:27,824
What happened?

527
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,159
I don't know.

528
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,329
Ruth just said she talked to Abbott.

529
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,623
She said someone came in
and made my case for me,

530
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,333
and I go back on Monday.

531
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,838
Hey, do you think it was Marty?

532
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,172
I don't know.

533
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:47,677
You think he felt guilty about my dad?
About what happened?

534
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,347
I'm not sure I know
who my parents are anymore.

535
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,170
Bet you were a teacher's pet.

536
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:30,637
Straight-A student. Sat in the front row.
Hair combed. Hand up first.

537
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,642
Yeah, you'd lose that bet.
I, um... I spent fifth grade in the hall.

538
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,978
I kept correcting the teacher's spelling.
She never appreciated it.

539
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,606
You always thought you were
the smartest one in the room, huh?

540
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,359
Some rooms are smarter than others.

541
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,782
You got Wyatt back into school,
didn't you?

542
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,913
It didn't seem fair.

543
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,375
Like being tossed out of the classroom
for knowing more than the teacher?

544
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,961
Listen, um...

545
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:09,050
I... I should've protected you
from the cartel.

546
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,636
I know it doesn't mean much,
but I blame myself.

547
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,430
You should.

548
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,437
I want my office back.

549
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,941
Anything else?

550
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,487
It's a start.

551
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,532
Turn off the lights when you leave.

552
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,248
You bought that?

553
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,500
Not exactly.

554
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,295
What did you do?

555
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,256
What does it matter? It's yours.

556
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,676
I don't want it.

557
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,803
Why? What's wrong?

558
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,767
You just don't get it.
It's like what happened at school.

559
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:41,893
If you get caught,

560
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,604
you get a slap on the wrist.
Marty pays for the book.

561
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,272
I get caught, I go to fucking jail.

562
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,108
You liked it so much,
and I wanted to get it for you, so...

563
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,611
I just got back into school,
for Christ's sake.

564
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,738
- I thought you hated school.
- I...

565
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,449
That's not what I said, Charlotte.

566
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,621
- I'm sorry, okay? It was stupid.
- No...

567
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:07,168
You just don't understand
who my family is, okay?

568
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,545
The shit that they've done,
it's like I can't escape it.

569
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:14,801
Oh, Jesus, you think you're the only one?
I saw a guy get killed in my house.

570
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:18,513
I loaded money into a wall.
The fucking FBI raided us.

571
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,432
My parents are paranoid
about anyone I hang out with.

572
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,768
And now we have a baby,

573
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,062
and I know they're lying
about how they got it.

574
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,482
A fucking baby!
It's all just so fucked up.

575
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,073
Why would you do that?

576
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,826
Do you have any idea
how much that's worth?

577
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,418
Charlotte, will you let your brother know
that dinner's ready, please?

578
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,671
Jonah!

579
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,631
That's great. I could have done that.

580
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,099
Take a seat, sweetheart.

581
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,976
Sorry, I was just finishing up.

582
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,562
What were you finishing up?

583
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,108
Jonah is...

584
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,736
um, creating an online profile...

585
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,864
for Mike Fleming.

586
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,076
What does that mean?

587
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,329
We're using his account,
only temporarily.

588
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,207
The Blake Foundation
is having a benefit tomorrow night,

589
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,293
and we'll see if Wilkes bites.

590
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,086
You didn't need to ask Jonah.

591
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,882
It was an emergency, and you were busy.

592
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,681
What'd you do today, Charlotte?

593
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,350
I stole a book.

594
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,853
- You what?
- You stole a book?

595
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,940
A first edition of <i>Look Homeward, Angel,</i>
from an antiquarian bookstore.

596
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,358
Why would you do that?

597
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,029
I don't know.
Because I'm a Byrde and that's what we do.

598
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,530
Then you return it.

599
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:02,617
- It's too late. I gave it to someone.
- Then you need to pay them for it.

600
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,828
You don't steal things from a store.
You know that.

601
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,417
This is insane. You see that, right?

602
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,008
Charlotte. Charlotte!

603
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,889
Hi, Helen.

604
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,433
<i>I got the link you sent
and did some digging.</i>

605
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,393
<i>Check your inbox. I think you'll be happy.</i>

606
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,027
- Yeah?
<i>- It's me. I wake you?</i>

607
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,364
- What do you think?
<i>- Yeah, say hello to Sherry.</i>

608
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,033
<i>- She finish your taxes yet?</i>
- Fuck off.

609
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,369
What do you want?

610
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,789
<i>Well, I paid off a teller at the bank
that made the wire transfer.</i>

611
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,625
<i>The name of the anonymous benefactor
is Michael Fleming.</i>

612
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,879
Michael... Never heard of him.

613
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,674
<i>That's because he's a 14-year-old boy.</i>

614
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,259
What?

615
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:04,762
<i>Evidently, his father died
and left him a foundation.</i>

616
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,306
<i>They need to make some bequests
for tax reasons.</i>

617
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:12,603
<i>Hello.</i>

618
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:14,689
I'm here.

619
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,982
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

620
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,316
<i>- If I had more time...</i>
- It's fine.

621
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:23,239
The world needs a little bit more trust.
Just accept it. Accept the money.

622
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,002
There's not much to like
about the Ozarks, but, man...

623
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,547
This French toast is...

624
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,468
I think it's the fresh buttermilk.

625
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,017
You gonna give me the details
of the Snell operation,

626
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,310
or are you on your way out?

627
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,953
<i>You're a fucking angel.
I needed a fix, and there you were.</i>

628
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:12,997
<i>How did you know who I was?</i>

629
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,874
<i>I'm a friend of your son's.
You want me to tie you off?</i>

630
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,043
- <i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

631
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,818
You're a fucking angel.

632
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,363
<i>Angel.</i>

633
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,032
I will fucking kill you.

634
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,409
No, you won't.

635
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,496
Not if you care about your mother.

636
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,670
You're gonna let Rachel go,
and you're gonna drop all pending charges.

637
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,216
If she gets so much as a parking ticket...

638
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,512
You proud of yourself?

639
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,057
Threatening a sick woman?

640
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,562
No.

641
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,690
Not for a second.

642
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,187
Hello, Charlie.

643
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,315
I didn't know you had an eye for art.

644
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,195
I don't. It's a commodity,
like everything else. Should I buy it?

645
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,407
It's better than hog futures,
and it's for a good cause.

646
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,453
Mind if I borrow your date?

647
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,747
As long as you return him
in the same condition.

648
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,304
What are you doing here?

649
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,973
I heard you finally made good
on your donation.

650
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,517
- Yeah? Where'd you hear that?
- Susan Blake.

651
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:39,852
Oh, you're friends now?

652
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,605
- We have mutual interests.
- Like what?

653
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,025
Like making sure promises are lived up to.

654
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,195
Are you trying to tell me something?

655
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:54,408
Marty and I facilitated the donation
from Mike Fleming to you.

656
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:58,662
My position has not changed on the casino.
I am still out.

657
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,080
I assumed.

658
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,042
Unfortunately, you just accepted
Mexican drug cartel money

659
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,669
and helped launder it
through a Guyanese charity.

660
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,423
That is just not a good look
for a moralist like you.

661
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,843
We had no idea where that money came from.

662
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,013
I'm not so sure
the FBI will see it that way.

663
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,181
And once they start looking into

664
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,643
how you use your own charity
as your own personal piggy bank,

665
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,562
well, I guess you're looking at
tax evasion,

666
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,939
wire fraud, money laundering...

667
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,274
- You fucking set me up?
- Hey.

668
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,902
Take a drink, Charlie.

669
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,863
Smile. People are watching.

670
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,784
You try and take me down,

671
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,120
believe me,
I take you and Marty down with me.

672
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,997
I don't doubt that for a second,

673
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,208
but there's a less painful way out
of this,

674
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,960
one where you get to keep the donation,

675
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,045
recoupable against your piece
of the profits,

676
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,423
and we get the casino.
Just help us get through the commission.

677
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,970
You are one cold-hearted bitch.

678
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,485
Let's go.

679
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,118
Camera to the left.

680
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,676
Oh, shit.

681
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,406
Fuck.

682
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,956
God damn it. Fuck.

683
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,253
Fuck!

684
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,797
Where is it?

685
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,885
Maybe I just got it wrong.

686
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,388
You're always wrong
when it comes to Marty fucking Byrde.

687
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:25,684
You are like a fucking dog,
going to whoever feeds you.

688
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,228
I saw the hearse. It has to be here.

689
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,855
Yeah? And when was that?

690
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,274
- How long you been holding out?
- I'm not holding out.

691
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:35,194
You been leading me on this
fucking goose chase for months now.

692
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,238
- Where the fuck's the money?
- I don't know!

693
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,660
You know what? You're worthless to me.

694
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:48,540
You're like a piece of shit
on the bottom of my shoe. Yeah.

695
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,502
Don't say that, Daddy.

696
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:57,675
You made me do it.
When are you gonna learn?

697
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,388
What, are you gonna cut me now?

698
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,516
You ungrateful fucking cunt.

699
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,203
What were you running from, Buddy?

700
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,915
Ghosts?

701
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,170
Were they in your dreams?

702
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,591
Did they forgive you?

703
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,488
Bye, Buddy.

704
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,242
I'll be seeing you.

705
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,343
Hey.

706
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,055
- Hi.
- Can I come in?

707
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,361
How do you feel?

708
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,782
Um, okay.

709
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,242
Good.

710
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,582
Petty is not going to be
bothering you anymore.

711
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,464
How'd you get me out?

712
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,884
He had a change of heart.

713
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,144
What's this?

714
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,563
That's a plane ticket.

715
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:21,819
To Miami?

716
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,780
There's a clinic there
where you can clean up.

717
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,450
I said I wanted to help,
and this is what it looks like.

718
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,868
Well, I can't even afford that, so...

719
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,703
It's paid for. It's done.

720
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:39,044
And this is an advance on the Blue Cat.

721
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,798
You send me your account information,
and I'll deposit the rest.

722
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,721
I guess I should say thank you.

723
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,599
No.

724
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,896
I fucked your life up pretty good.

725
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:04,945
Hey, Marty.

726
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,868
I, uh...

727
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:40,731
Thank you.

728
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,448
- Y'all take care.
- Appreciate it.

729
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,949
Wonderful sermon, Reverend.

730
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,286
The nature of salvation.
Gave me a lot to think about.

731
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,203
Thank you.

732
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:58,248
And that fried chicken.
It must be genetic.

733
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,293
Women around these parts
all just seem to know how to cook.

734
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,420
- Isn't that right, Darlene?
- Mmm.

735
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,880
Oh, it was good to see you, Darlene.

736
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:05,923
Well...

737
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,009
- good night now.
- Good night.

738
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,804
Jesus, it's just fucking fried chicken.

739
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,765
A cat could make it.

740
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:18,727
Thank you.

741
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,014
Y'all got a problem?

742
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,997
Where have you been?
It's late. We've been worried.

743
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,795
I have something
I wanna talk to you about.

744
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,507
What is it?

745
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,682
I wanna get emancipated.

746
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,643
- What are you talking about?
- What?

747
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:44,438
Do you remember Jordan Parks
from back home?

748
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,191
He did it. He had his own apartment
when he was a senior.

749
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,611
That kid's parents are drug addicts.

750
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,072
- There's a difference there.
- This is silly.

751
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,367
You'd have to pay for rent, food, clothes.

752
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,285
I'll get a job.

753
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,162
Where? McDonald's?

754
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:02,998
You think minimum wage
would pay for all that?

755
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:07,919
Charlotte, I know things have been crazy,

756
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,048
- but we gotta stay together.
- Why?

757
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:12,883
We're a family.

758
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,634
What does that even mean?

759
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,221
I don't wanna hurt you.

760
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,601
I love you,
but I can't be a part of this anymore.

761
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:26,146
Everyone lies about everything.

762
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,356
It's gone too far.

763
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,235
You can fight me on this,
or you can help me.

764
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,740
I've made up my mind.

765
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,078
I want out.

766
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:48,713
