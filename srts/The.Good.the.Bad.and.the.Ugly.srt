2
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:40,397
You're from Baker?

3
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:54,202
Tell Baker that I told him
all that I know already.

4
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,912
Tell him I want to live in peace,
understand?

5
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:58,915
There is no use to go on tormenting me!

6
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,835
I know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

7
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,337
Now that gold has disappeared,
but if he'd listened...

8
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:06,089
we could have avoided this altogether.

9
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:10,385
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

10
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,138
They couldn't uncover any more.

11
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:16,141
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

12
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:18,143
Go back and tell him that.

13
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:23,065
Word's around you had a visitor...

14
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,360
and Baker knows it.

15
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,155
Name of Jackson.

16
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,535
Well...

17
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,329
Jackson was here...

18
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,458
or Baker's got it all wrong.

19
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:50,884
He's not wrong.

20
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:56,223
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

21
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:58,183
about the cash box.

22
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,981
That's not what I'm being paid for.

23
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:12,864
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

24
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,829
Why do you think Jackson may be
assuming another name?

25
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:21,248
I would have found him already.

26
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,460
When I start off to find somebody,
I find him.

27
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,504
That's why they pay me.

28
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:35,220
What is Baker paying you?

29
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:39,975
That your family?

30
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:51,236
Yes.

31
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,405
Nice family.

32
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:58,577
What does he pay you for murdering me?

33
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:04,374
Five hundred dollars...

34
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,042
to get the name.

35
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,800
The name.

36
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:25,979
Carson. Bill Carson.

37
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:29,232
That's what he calls himself now.

38
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:02,390
That's a lot of money... 1,000.

39
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:08,271
A thousand dollars?

40
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:14,110
And some in gold. That's a tidy sum.

41
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,869
But when I'm paid,
I always see the job through.

42
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:37,819
It's you.

43
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,529
Any information?

44
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,116
Too much.

45
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,370
He said quite a bit
that should interest you...

46
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,206
and one or two things that interested me.

47
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,708
Such as?

48
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,421
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

49
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,842
That's your bit.

50
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:05,305
Keep talking.

51
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:09,684
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box...

52
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,770
which just happened to disappear.

53
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:15,815
- That's my bit.
- Anything else?

54
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:18,902
Not enough for you, eh?

55
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,782
Well, you don't have to worry.
He won't say anything to anybody again.

56
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,242
Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect.

57
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:29,496
Here you are.

58
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,333
Here. This is for you.
You did a good job for me.

59
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,335
Worth $500.

60
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,382
Yeah. I almost forgot.

61
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,967
He gave me a thousand.

62
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:46,096
I think his idea was that I kill you.

63
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:58,900
But you know the pity is, when I'm paid,
I always follow my job through.

64
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,987
- You know that.
- No! Angel Eyes...

65
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,745
No. No pistol, amigo.
It won't do you any good.

66
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,705
There are three of us.

67
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:15,018
You know you've got a face
beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?

68
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:18,688
Yeah.

69
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:23,443
But you don't look
like the one who'll collect it.

70
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:33,036
A couple steps back.

71
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,967
Thank you.

72
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,520
How much are you worth now?

73
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:42,021
How much?

74
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:44,899
Two thousand dollars.

75
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,946
- That's right... $2,000.
- Yeah.

76
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:04,419
You'll pay for this!
I hope you end up in a graveyard...

77
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:08,047
with the cholera
and the rabies and the plague!

78
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:11,509
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!

79
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:13,219
Put me down!

80
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:17,974
I hope your mother ends up in
a two-dollar whorehouse! Cut me loose!

81
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:23,813
You can still save yourself.
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.

82
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:25,982
Let me go!

83
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:30,570
I think I feel sick.
The blood is bursting through my...

84
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,364
I'm dry, Blondie.

85
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:36,743
Water.

86
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,376
You swine! You son of a bitch!

87
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:46,836
Let me go!

88
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:51,007
You're brave with a man
who's tied up! Come back!

89
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:55,303
Come back and fight! You bastard.

90
00:20:56,805 --> 00:21:00,600
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

91
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:02,602
Cut it out! Cut it out!

92
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:06,022
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...

93
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:12,153
So, you're an honest farmer.
You recognize this man?

94
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,614
- Me?
- Yeah, it's you.

95
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:19,953
Me? Who says so? You can't even read.

96
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:22,121
Yeah, roll it up. Roll it up.

97
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:24,749
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

98
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,461
To hell with all you sheriffs and
deputies and all who gave birth to you.

99
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:31,839
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

100
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,093
Judas! You sold my hide!

101
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:37,387
But you won't enjoy
any of that money... not a penny.

102
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:41,474
If there's justice in the world,
every penny will go to the undertakers.

103
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:43,643
You know who you are?

104
00:21:43,727 --> 00:21:45,979
You want to know whose son you are?

105
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:48,356
You don't, I do. Everybody does.

106
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,193
You're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

107
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,404
And your mother... Your mother!

108
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,572
She's... You bastard!

109
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,201
Your mother...
it's better not to talk of her!

110
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,828

- No. How much?
- $3,000.

133
00:23:51,814 --> 00:23:54,607
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend...

134
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:58,611
those with a rope around their neck, and
the people who have the job of cutting.

135
00:23:58,695 --> 00:24:02,031
Listen, the neck
at the end of the rope is mine.

136
00:24:02,116 --> 00:24:03,741
I run the risks...

137
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:07,328
so the next time, I want more than half.

138
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:11,874
You may run the risks, my friend,
but I do the cutting.

00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:16,462
If we cut down my percentage...

140

Cigar?

141
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,636
It's liable to interfere with my aim.

you had better miss very well.

00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:32,955
But then the army decides, of course...

162
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,333
it ought to hold a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

163
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:39,337
- He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.
- I know his name.

164
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:42,465
But you don't know
just who you're looking for, and I do.

165
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,552
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

166
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:50,139
Where is Carson?

167
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:53,476
All I know is Carson reenlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

168
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,853
He lives with a girl called Maria
who'll tell you.

169
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:58,231
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

170
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:01,359
- Where's she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?

171
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,194
Someplace fairly near.

172
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:07,156
Santa Ana.

173
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:12,787
Adios, half-soldier.

174
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:19,001
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey!

175
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:21,128
"...and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

176
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,257
"The condemned hired himself out
as a guide to a wagon train.

177
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:27,677
"After receiving his payment in advance,
he deserted the wagon train...

178
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:30,346
"on the hunting grounds
of the Sioux Indians."

179
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,141
Glad they got him...
a man guilty of all those crimes.

180
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,060
People with ropes around their necks
don't always hang.

181
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:37,728
What do you mean?

182
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,939
"The condemned is also guilty..."

183
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:43,025
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

184
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:52,868
- "...as a Mexican general."
- A golden-haired angel watches over him.

185
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,788
"For all these crimes
the accused has made...

186
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,873
"a full, spontaneous confession.

187
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,502
"Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead."

188
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:04,505
May the Lord have mercy
on his soul. Proceed.

189
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,064
Let's get the hell out of here!

190
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:56,349
What are you trying to say...
anybody can miss a shot?

191
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,351
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

192
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:01,896
You've never had a rope around
your neck. I'll tell you something.

193
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,442
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass.

194
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:13,282
Yeah, you're right. It's getting tougher.

195
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:20,956
The way I figure, there's not too much
future with a sawed-off runt like you.

196
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,249
What do you mean?

197
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,795
'Cause I don't think
you'll ever be worth more than $3,000.

198
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,798
What do you mean?

199
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:31,801
I mean, our partnership is untied.

200
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:36,472
Oh, no. Not you. You remain tied.

201
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,267
I'll keep the money,
and you can have the rope.

202
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,812
You filthy, double-crossing bastard!

203
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:47,358
- Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...
- The way back to town is only 70 miles.

204
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,905
You know, if you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

205
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,284
You filthy bastard! Come here!

206
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,994
Come here! Cut this rope off!

207
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,248
Get off that horse, you filthy coward!

208
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:05,126
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

209
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,254
I'll scalp you! I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you up by your thumbs!

210
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:10,089
You pig! You vulture!

211
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:13,801
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

212
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,181
Such ingratitude, after all the times
I've saved your life.

213
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:26,480
Where are you going? Wait a minute.

214
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,108
This is only a trick.
You wouldn't leave me here.

215
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:32,111
Come back! Wait! Blondie!

216
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:33,863
Listen, Blondie...

217
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:00,890
I believe madam is home.

218
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:06,437
Sweet dreams, and many thanks
from the Seventh Cavalry!

219
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:17,072
You filthy rats!

220
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
Maria.

221
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,265
Honey? Is that you, Bill?

222
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:58,948
Who are you? What do you want with me?

223
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,284
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

224
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:05,120
I don't know him.

225
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:08,791
You were calling to him in the dark.

226
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,421
Where is he?

227
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,715
What are you going to do to him?

228
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,177
I'll ask the questions.

229
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,847
Where is he?

230
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,440
Where is he? Where?

231
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:42,908
That's enough!

232
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,830
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago...

233
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:50,708
and went away with his unit...
they all left.

234
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:53,669
Which company? Where'd they go?

235
00:31:57,674 --> 00:32:02,428
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

236
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:05,681
That's all I know, I swear!

237
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,936
But, but...

238
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:41,151
I'm very sorry, but the store's closing.

239
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:22,192
- Revolvers.
- Yeah, revolvers.

240
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,157
Revolvers.

241
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,035
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.

242
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,835
Here. Remington, Colt...

243
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,338
a Roat, Smith-Wesson...

244
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,591
Colt... Navy...

245
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:48,177
Joslyn...

246
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,803
another Remington.

247
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,930
- And this one is...
- That's enough.

248
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:36,266
Cartridges.

249
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,236
You want to try the pistol?
Just step out back.

250
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,612
Let's go.

251
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,078
Move. Move.

252
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,905
Cartridge.

253
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,749
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

254
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:27,794
No.

255
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:32,799
Fifty dollars.

256
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,969
How much?

257
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,430
A hundred dollars.

258
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,601
Two hundred dollars.

259
00:37:42,685 --> 00:37:44,353
It's all I've got.

260
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:46,396
Here.

261
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,542
Come here.

262
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,976
This morning I heard the whole thing.

263
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,187
They say that Colonel Canby's
closing in with his Northerners...

264
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:44,148
and no later than tomorrow
that they'll be in the city.

265
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:47,276
That's why these Southerners
are getting out.

266
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,779
You see, as soon as these cowards hear
a Blue Shirt's around, they run.

267
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:54,533
- These Rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

268
00:38:54,618 --> 00:38:56,202
They'll soon be finished.

269
00:38:56,286 --> 00:38:59,872
We get rid of these bastards, then we
begin making money on those Yankees.

270
00:38:59,956 --> 00:39:04,001
They carry gold, not paper dollars,
and they're going to beat the South.

271
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,589
Look. See that one with the white beard
sitting in the wagon?

272
00:39:08,673 --> 00:39:10,716
General Sibley. He looks dead.

273
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,136
He's finally getting out of our hair.
Hurray for Dixie!

274
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,604
Where's the owner of that horse?

275
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:27,733
- Please, sir, a bad heart condition...
- Where?

276
00:39:27,817 --> 00:39:30,486
The war has frightened me already.

277
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,905
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

278
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:37,910
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar,
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

279
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:40,913
You leave him be.
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

280
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:43,123
You stay quiet, old hen.

281
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:48,337
Upstairs. Upstairs in room four, señor.

282
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:55,511
Hear that?

283
00:40:00,892 --> 00:40:03,394
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

284
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:19,882
Your spurs.

285
00:43:35,356 --> 00:43:38,025
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend...

286
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:40,986
those that come in by the door...

287
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,697
and those that come in by the window.

288
00:43:43,781 --> 00:43:45,949
Take off that pistol belt.

289
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,833
It's empty.

290
00:43:57,587 --> 00:43:59,004
Mine isn't.

291
00:44:05,678 --> 00:44:09,097
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm too.

292
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:15,437
That could be cannon fire.

293
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,607
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

294
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:23,946
You ever see this before, my friend?

295
00:44:33,414 --> 00:44:35,582
Throw it over the roof beam.

296
00:44:37,835 --> 00:44:39,211
That's it.

297
00:44:50,848 --> 00:44:52,641
Now get on that.

298
00:45:02,735 --> 00:45:04,486
That's right.

299
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:07,114
Now make sure the rope is tight.

300
00:45:07,198 --> 00:45:09,783
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

301
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:19,042
Now put the rope around your neck.

302
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:27,884
That's very good.

303
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:31,013
It's too big for your neck, huh?

304
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:34,266
We fix that right away.
I have another system...

305
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:37,019
a little different than yours.

306
00:45:37,979 --> 00:45:41,773
I don't shoot the rope.
I shoot the legs off the stool.

307
00:48:58,387 --> 00:48:59,930
Welcome, my friend.

308
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:03,683
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot, you've found it.

309
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:07,229
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

310
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:11,399
And the attractions don't stop there.

311
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:15,654
International cuisine,
healthful and nutritious food.

312
00:49:15,738 --> 00:49:17,697
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.

313
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:20,617
Our government has spared no expense.

314
00:49:20,701 --> 00:49:23,370
As you can see, we are treated very well.

315
00:49:23,454 --> 00:49:26,873
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

316
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:32,337
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

317
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:36,591
Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel
who decided to tear us to pieces.

318
00:49:36,676 --> 00:49:39,678
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

319
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:42,097
And you ask me if I know someone.

320
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:46,184
I just don't know what you drifters
could be thinking.

321
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:01,408
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the Third.

322
00:50:03,786 --> 00:50:07,581
If he's with the Third,
they've already left.

323
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,666
For Glorieta.

324
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,879
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.

325
00:50:13,963 --> 00:50:18,800
And the desert lies ahead of them. I really
doubt that any of them are still alive.

326
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:22,554
And what if they were still alive?

327
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:26,308
Worse.

328
00:50:27,184 --> 00:50:30,854
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

329
00:50:30,938 --> 00:50:35,609
It's one of those Yankee prison camps
you'd better hope you never end up in.

330
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,653
Keep it. It's yours.

331
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:08,219
"We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson...

332
00:53:08,304 --> 00:53:10,930
"guilty of the following crimes:

333
00:53:11,015 --> 00:53:15,018
"horse theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union Army...

334
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:17,979
"theft of supplies belonging
to the Confederate Army...

335
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,939
"wounding two vigilantes...

336
00:53:20,024 --> 00:53:22,984
"assault and battery on
one named Barry O'Keefe...

337
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:26,196
"perjury, blackmail, robbery...

338
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,449
"escaping from a state prison,
disturbing the peace...

339
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:32,368
- "pandering, highway robbery..."
- And Shorty?

340
00:53:32,453 --> 00:53:33,953
"forgery and murder.

341
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:36,831
"Therefore, with the powers vested in us
by the laws of this state..."

342
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:39,125
- No.
- No?

343
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,920
"...we have condemned
the aforementioned Thomas Larson...

344
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:43,338
"alias Shorty Larson...

345
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,632
"to hang by the neck until dead."

346
00:53:45,716 --> 00:53:48,968
May God have mercy on his soul. Proceed.

347
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,185
Sorry, Shorty.

348
00:53:58,813 --> 00:54:00,438
Move. Come on, let's go.

349
00:54:25,923 --> 00:54:29,134
I don't know. As soon as I hit
the desert, I'm thirsty.

350
00:54:29,218 --> 00:54:34,264
Burns, huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

351
00:54:58,455 --> 00:55:01,082
Like that,
you won't have to carry so much.

352
00:55:03,085 --> 00:55:05,461
Where we going?

353
00:55:05,546 --> 00:55:08,715
Where? Where I'm going, amigo.

354
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:11,384
Over that way.

355
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:15,847
Another hundred miles
of beautiful, sunbaked sand.

356
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:18,308
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

357
00:55:18,392 --> 00:55:20,685
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

358
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:22,687
Canby's men are coming here.

359
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:26,983
But no one will set foot in this hell...

360
00:55:28,152 --> 00:55:30,236
except you and me.

361
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:34,866
One hundred miles... that's a nice walk.

362
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:40,580
What was it you told me the last time?

363
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:46,586
"If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it."

364
00:55:48,797 --> 00:55:53,134
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die, only slowly...

365
00:55:54,428 --> 00:55:56,804
very slowly, old friend.

366
00:56:01,977 --> 00:56:04,646
After you, please. Start walking.

367
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:03,056
Taking a rest?

368
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:06,684
Come on, Blondie.
We don't have very far to go.

369
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:08,603
Only 70 miles.

370
00:58:09,938 --> 00:58:12,940
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

371
00:58:13,776 --> 00:58:15,610
That's not too bad.

372
00:58:17,196 --> 00:58:18,780
Come on.

373
01:00:09,391 --> 01:00:11,058
Okay, let's eat.

374
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:13,644
That is, I'll eat.

375
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:19,984
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.

376
01:00:29,786 --> 01:00:31,412
You want some water?

377
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:37,460
Drink. Drink.

378
01:00:43,592 --> 01:00:45,259
Come on. Come on.

379
01:01:26,718 --> 01:01:29,470
Well, Blondie. So long.

380
01:02:37,247 --> 01:02:38,914
And so, Blondie...

381
01:02:41,543 --> 01:02:43,294
it's good-bye.

382
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

383
01:03:41,603 --> 01:03:42,978
Whoa, boy.

384
01:03:47,025 --> 01:03:48,442
Easy, easy.

385
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:51,445
Easy, easy. Attaboy. That's nice.

386
01:06:20,303 --> 01:06:23,472
Water. Water.

387
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:33,482
200,000 in gold.
It's yours. Just get me water.

388
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,573
What's that you say?

389
01:06:41,116 --> 01:06:42,867
Who the hell are you?

390
01:06:42,951 --> 01:06:44,243
Carson.

391
01:06:44,953 --> 01:06:47,621
My name is Bill Carson now. It's Carson.

392
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:49,748
Surprise attack.

393
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:55,379
All dead. My name is Jackson, not Carson.

394
01:06:55,463 --> 01:06:57,756
Carson, yeah, yeah.
Glad to meet you, Carson.

395
01:06:57,841 --> 01:07:01,594
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What did you say about the dollars?

396
01:07:01,678 --> 01:07:03,470
200,000... all mine.

397
01:07:05,056 --> 01:07:06,807
Was the Third Cavalry's.

398
01:07:08,143 --> 01:07:10,144
Baker has nothing.

399
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:14,732
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

400
01:07:15,817 --> 01:07:17,776
Where? Where, here?

401
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,361
Here? Talk!

402
01:07:19,446 --> 01:07:22,031
- Huh?
- In the cemetery.

403
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:25,618
- Which cemetery?
- The one...

404
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:27,912
on Sad Hill.

405
01:07:28,747 --> 01:07:30,873
There's a grave by...

406
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,917
Which grave?

407
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:35,419
Have a name? Have a number?

408
01:07:35,503 --> 01:07:37,963
Come on, you dummy, talk.

409
01:07:39,549 --> 01:07:43,427
There's no number. There's a name.

410
01:07:43,845 --> 01:07:46,055
- Huh?
- It's written...

411
01:07:46,723 --> 01:07:47,932
Yes?

412
01:07:53,813 --> 01:07:55,230
Water!

413
01:07:57,692 --> 01:08:00,611
You talk first, huh?
I'll give you water later.

414
01:08:00,695 --> 01:08:03,697
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.
In the grave. Okay.

415
01:08:03,782 --> 01:08:06,241
But it must have a name
or a number on it, huh?

416
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:09,036
There must be a thousand, five thousand!

417
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:17,753
Don't die, huh?
Don't die. I'll get you water.

418
01:08:17,837 --> 01:08:21,173
Stay there. Don't move. I'll get you water.

419
01:08:21,257 --> 01:08:23,884
Don't die until later, you son of a...

420
01:08:49,327 --> 01:08:51,078
Get away from there!

421
01:08:57,085 --> 01:08:59,253
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

422
01:09:02,257 --> 01:09:03,924
I'll kill you.

423
01:09:06,761 --> 01:09:09,847
If you do that, you'll always be poor...

424
01:09:10,974 --> 01:09:14,476
just like the greasy rat that you are.

425
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:18,856
If I were you, I'd keep me alive.

426
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:22,192
What did he tell you, huh?

427
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:24,695
- A name.
- Huh?

428
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:27,740
- A name on a grave.
- What name?

429
01:09:42,297 --> 01:09:44,381
Blondie, don't die.

430
01:09:44,466 --> 01:09:47,885
Blondie, don't die. I'm your friend.

431
01:09:47,969 --> 01:09:51,638
Please don't die. Please!
I'm your friend. Come on.

432
01:09:55,226 --> 01:09:58,896
I'll help you. I'll help you.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

433
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,232
Here's the water. Don't die like that pig.

434
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:06,236
Hey, Blondie, here's water. Water, Blondie.

435
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:08,238
Don't drink, don't drink.
Is no good for you.

436
01:10:08,323 --> 01:10:10,074
Feel better?

437
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:13,619
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please, don't die.

438
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:26,048
Hey, open up! Open up! Hurry!

439
01:10:26,132 --> 01:10:28,884
Settle down. Settle down. Who's there?

440
01:10:30,637 --> 01:10:34,181
What do you mean, "Who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

441
01:10:37,185 --> 01:10:40,979
If I were a Yankee,
you wouldn't have time to ask me that.

442
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:42,397
Come on.

443
01:10:42,482 --> 01:10:45,192
Sergeant, listen to
this corporal for a moment.

444
01:10:45,276 --> 01:10:46,276
Yes, sir.

445
01:10:46,361 --> 01:10:50,823
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man
here, if he's not dead already.

446
01:10:53,368 --> 01:10:56,578
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.

447
01:10:57,997 --> 01:10:59,623
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

448
01:10:59,707 --> 01:11:03,752
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and traveling papers.

449
01:11:05,713 --> 01:11:09,716
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
Third Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

450
01:11:09,801 --> 01:11:12,469
arriving from San Rafael. Is that enough?

451
01:11:18,226 --> 01:11:20,894
Are you reading when this man is dying?

452
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:24,815
Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw
and you're looking for an infirmary?

453
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:28,569
If you want one, you'll have
to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

454
01:11:29,404 --> 01:11:32,698
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

455
01:11:34,325 --> 01:11:36,660
- Apache Canyon?
- Apache Canyon.

456
01:11:36,744 --> 01:11:39,163
Is a Mission San Antonio around here?

457
01:11:39,247 --> 01:11:41,623
Sure, 18 miles south. Take him there.

458
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:45,502
The brothers take care of any wounded,
no matter what the color of his uniform.

459
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:48,255
And keep your eyes open,
the area is full of Yankees.

460
01:11:48,339 --> 01:11:50,090
Thank you. Goodbye, Sergeant.

461
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:51,425
Take care.

462
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,119
- I've got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds here.

463
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:21,121
Let him have yours.

464
01:12:26,794 --> 01:12:29,004
- Where's Pablo Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez.

465
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:30,964
He's away at the moment.

466
01:12:31,049 --> 01:12:33,425
He should be back any day now.

467
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:37,888
Well, it doesn't matter. For the moment,
we take very good care of my friend.

468
01:12:37,972 --> 01:12:39,723
And may God be praised.

469
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:42,184
In case you didn't know it,
God is on our side too...

470
01:12:42,268 --> 01:12:45,395
because He hates the Yanks, huh, Blondie?

471
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,940
Blondie? Father, is he still breathing?

472
01:12:48,024 --> 01:12:51,902
- Yes, of course.
- You're heavy.

473
01:13:03,581 --> 01:13:04,790
There.

474
01:13:34,654 --> 01:13:37,072
All right, put a fresh bandage on him.

475
01:13:38,491 --> 01:13:40,200
Put him in my cell.

476
01:13:41,244 --> 01:13:42,619
Easy.

477
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:48,792
- Out, soldier. Out you go. Come on.
- Look out for him, please.

478
01:13:48,876 --> 01:13:50,877
He's like a brother to me.

479
01:13:56,634 --> 01:13:58,552
Hey, Father, I...

480
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:13,942
Father, did he speak? Did he say anything?

481
01:14:44,599 --> 01:14:46,850
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything, Father?

482
01:14:46,934 --> 01:14:50,020
Oh, no, he hasn't spoken as yet.
But you mustn't worry.

483
01:14:50,104 --> 01:14:54,107
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him going until now.

484
01:14:54,192 --> 01:14:56,651
He should regain his strength
in a very short time.

485
01:14:56,736 --> 01:14:59,279
Thank you, Father. You don't know
how much this boy's life means to me.

486
01:14:59,364 --> 01:15:01,448
Thanks be to Jesus. Thanks to all of you.

487
01:15:58,005 --> 01:15:59,673
Hey, Blondie.

488
01:16:19,861 --> 01:16:23,613
The old father tells me you'll be
up and around in a few days.

489
01:16:23,698 --> 01:16:27,451
You're very lucky
to have me so close when it happened.

490
01:16:27,535 --> 01:16:30,078
Think if you'd been on your own.

491
01:16:31,289 --> 01:16:33,832
Look, I mean, when...

492
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:36,626
when one is ill...

493
01:16:36,711 --> 01:16:39,296
it's good to have somebody close by...

494
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:41,339
friends or relations.

495
01:16:42,175 --> 01:16:47,345
Do you have parents, Blondie? A mother?

496
01:16:48,097 --> 01:16:49,890
Not even a mother.

497
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,434
No one?

498
01:16:53,311 --> 01:16:56,104
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

499
01:16:56,814 --> 01:16:59,149
We're all alone in the world.

500
01:16:59,859 --> 01:17:02,444
I have you, you have me.

501
01:17:04,614 --> 01:17:06,364
Only for a little while, I mean.

502
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:09,117
It had to happen now.

503
01:17:09,911 --> 01:17:12,329
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

504
01:17:12,413 --> 01:17:15,415
We could have all that money
in our hands.

505
01:17:22,048 --> 01:17:24,382
I must tell you the truth.

506
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:27,302
In my place, you would do the same thing.

507
01:17:29,263 --> 01:17:31,431
It's all over for you now.

508
01:17:32,183 --> 01:17:34,935
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.

509
01:17:37,438 --> 01:17:41,900
God help me. It's my fault.
Mine, mine, mine.

510
01:17:53,287 --> 01:17:55,956
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

511
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:59,543
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear...

512
01:17:59,627 --> 01:18:02,921
in my place... in your place,
I would do the same thing.

513
01:18:03,798 --> 01:18:07,217
I would tell about the gold. Yes, I would.

514
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:09,719
I'd tell the name on the grave.

515
01:18:09,804 --> 01:18:12,472
After all, what good is
the money to you if you're dead?

516
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:16,810
I know the name of the cemetery,
but you know how many graves are there?

517
01:18:17,812 --> 01:18:21,189
Please, Blondie.

518
01:18:21,274 --> 01:18:27,404
Please, have a little, huh? Here. Coffee.

519
01:18:27,488 --> 01:18:29,322
Please, tell me the name...

520
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:32,659
on the grave.

521
01:18:33,953 --> 01:18:37,080
If I get my hands on the $200,000...

522
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:40,792
I'll always honor your memory.

523
01:18:41,752 --> 01:18:44,963
I swear, I'll always honor your memory.

524
01:18:48,009 --> 01:18:50,010
Come closer.

525
01:18:55,016 --> 01:18:56,600
Tell me.

526
01:18:57,977 --> 01:18:59,603
Why, you dirty...

527
01:19:01,647 --> 01:19:04,441
I'll sleep better...

528
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:10,196
knowing my good friend is by my side...

529
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:12,115
to protect me.

530
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:23,043
"Tuco, water." Here's water.

531
01:19:23,127 --> 01:19:26,379
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water.

532
01:19:33,888 --> 01:19:36,681
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

533
01:19:36,766 --> 01:19:38,850
Come on, the party's over.

534
01:19:38,934 --> 01:19:40,894
The wagon is all ready to go.

535
01:19:40,978 --> 01:19:43,980
From the way the wounded are pouring
into this place, we better leave...

536
01:19:44,065 --> 01:19:46,191
before we get caught up in the war.

537
01:19:46,275 --> 01:19:49,402
- Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
- Yeah.

538
01:19:49,487 --> 01:19:54,032
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

539
01:19:54,116 --> 01:19:56,076
- Where, this way?
- Yes.

540
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,750
Don't you recognize me?

541
01:20:27,503 --> 01:20:31,422
It's me, Tuco. Let me embrace you.

542
01:20:35,093 --> 01:20:37,512
I don't know the right thing.

543
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:44,863
I was just passing by here,
I said to myself...

544
01:20:44,948 --> 01:20:47,282
"I wonder if my brother
remembers his brother."

545
01:20:51,371 --> 01:20:52,871
Did I do wrong?

546
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,834
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

547
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:58,877
You have seen me, Tuco.

548
01:21:01,131 --> 01:21:03,799
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

549
01:21:09,556 --> 01:21:11,849
Oh, my uniform!

550
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,851
It's a long story.

551
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:19,064
But let's talk about you.
It's more important. You look very well.

552
01:21:19,816 --> 01:21:21,734
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

553
01:21:23,695 --> 01:21:26,530
you were always thin, eh, Pablito?

554
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:31,326
What about our parents?

555
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:37,916
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

556
01:21:40,587 --> 01:21:42,504
Nine years?

557
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,551
So it's nine years. Nine years!

558
01:21:48,845 --> 01:21:51,430
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

559
01:21:53,057 --> 01:21:55,434
Our father died only a few days ago.

560
01:21:56,436 --> 01:21:58,228
That's why I was away.

561
01:22:00,231 --> 01:22:03,817
He asked for you to be there,
but there was only me.

562
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:13,869
And you?

563
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:16,872
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

564
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:21,043
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

565
01:22:24,464 --> 01:22:26,423
Not one. Lots of them.

566
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:29,092
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

567
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:32,846
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

568
01:22:34,933 --> 01:22:36,892
What good would that be?

569
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:41,730
Just keep on the way you're going.
Go away.

570
01:22:43,942 --> 01:22:46,109
- And the Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go, I'll go.

571
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:48,987
While I'm waiting for the Lord
to remember me...

572
01:22:49,072 --> 01:22:52,282
I, Tuco Ramirez,
brother of Brother Ramirez...

573
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:54,660
will tell you something.

574
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:56,829
You think you're better than I am.

575
01:22:56,913 --> 01:22:59,540
Where we came from,
if one didn't want to die of poverty...

576
01:22:59,624 --> 01:23:02,042
one became a priest or a bandit.

577
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:04,670
You chose your way, I chose mine.

578
01:23:04,754 --> 01:23:06,505
Mine was harder!

579
01:23:06,589 --> 01:23:08,215
You talk about Mother and Father.

580
01:23:08,299 --> 01:23:11,885
You remember, when you left
to become a priest, I stayed behind.

581
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:15,848
I must have been ten, twelve.
I don't remember which, but I stayed.

582
01:23:15,932 --> 01:23:20,477
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I will tell you something.

583
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:25,607
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

584
01:23:43,459 --> 01:23:44,626
Tuco.

585
01:23:55,805 --> 01:23:57,764
Please forgive me, brother.

586
01:24:26,836 --> 01:24:29,004
Ah, my belly's full.

587
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:33,425
Nice guy, my brother.

588
01:24:33,509 --> 01:24:35,886
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

589
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:38,096
Everything. Like the pope almost.

590
01:24:38,181 --> 01:24:41,725
He's in charge in Rome.
Yeah, yeah, my brother, he say to me...

591
01:24:41,809 --> 01:24:45,520
"Stay, brother. Don't go home.
We never see each other.

592
01:24:45,605 --> 01:24:50,108
"Here there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too."

593
01:24:50,193 --> 01:24:55,113
Whenever we see each other, he never
lets me go. It's always the same story.

594
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:57,950
My brother... he is crazy about me.

595
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:05,749
That's so. Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens...

596
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:11,505
I know there's a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.

597
01:25:13,424 --> 01:25:14,549
Sure.

598
01:25:16,344 --> 01:25:19,888
Well, after a meal,
there's nothing like a good cigar.

599
01:26:10,773 --> 01:26:13,066
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

600
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,403
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.

601
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,197
That sure is a long way.

602
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:23,910
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas...

603
01:26:24,787 --> 01:26:26,705
- After that...
- Then what?

604
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:32,085
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?

605
01:26:35,715 --> 01:26:38,967
Those men aren't worried
about anything anymore, are they?

606
01:26:41,971 --> 01:26:43,764
But since I'm alive and I've noticed

607
01:26:43,848 --> 01:26:47,392
we'll be crossing Yankee and
Confederate lines a few times.

608
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:50,645
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

609
01:26:51,481 --> 01:26:55,025
Towards $200,000.
Is that good enough for you?

610
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:10,665
Whoa.

611
01:27:14,504 --> 01:27:16,880
Hey, wake up, you.

612
01:27:16,964 --> 01:27:19,883
- The troops are coming. Come on.
- Blue or gray?

613
01:27:27,016 --> 01:27:30,644
They're gray like us. Let's say
"hello" to them and then get going.

614
01:27:30,728 --> 01:27:34,606
Hoorah! Hoorah for the Confederacy!

615
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:37,984
Hoorah! Down with General Grant!

616
01:27:38,069 --> 01:27:41,154
- Hoorah for General... what's his name?
- Lee.

617
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:42,948
Lee!

618
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:47,160
God is with us
because He hates the Yanks too!

619
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:52,666
God's not on our side
'cause He hates idiots also.

620
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,389
Hut, two, three, four.

621
01:28:12,895 --> 01:28:15,480
Prisoners of war, forward!

622
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,733
March!

623
01:29:10,786 --> 01:29:12,245
Halt!

624
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:17,792
Left face!

625
01:29:21,088 --> 01:29:24,090
Form a single file. Move!

626
01:30:06,425 --> 01:30:09,177
- Jonathan Frost!
- Present!

627
01:30:15,851 --> 01:30:18,770
- Richard McGilley!
- Present!

628
01:30:18,854 --> 01:30:21,773
- Nathaniel Sullivan!
- Present.

629
01:30:23,067 --> 01:30:26,069
- Robert Clark!
- Present.

630
01:30:26,862 --> 01:30:29,030
- Sam Richmond!
- Present.

631
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:34,452
Bill Carson.

632
01:30:40,459 --> 01:30:42,669
I said Bill Carson!

633
01:30:42,753 --> 01:30:45,922
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

634
01:30:46,716 --> 01:30:49,301
All right, what's he doing, sleeping?

635
01:30:52,763 --> 01:30:55,932
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.

636
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:57,809
Bill Carson!

637
01:30:57,893 --> 01:31:00,145
Yeah, that's me.

638
01:31:08,779 --> 01:31:10,822
Please, Carson...

639
01:31:12,074 --> 01:31:13,867
answer "present."

640
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:17,454
What are you, deaf?

641
01:31:23,336 --> 01:31:26,254
Now suppose you say "present," Carson.

642
01:31:27,673 --> 01:31:30,842
I like big fat men like you.

643
01:31:30,926 --> 01:31:32,802
When they fall, they make more noise...

644
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:35,347
and sometimes they never get up.

645
01:31:36,682 --> 01:31:38,099
Wallace...

646
01:31:39,935 --> 01:31:41,436
that's enough.

647
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:45,523
Sergeant!

648
01:31:47,777 --> 01:31:50,236
The captain wants to see you right away.

649
01:31:53,783 --> 01:31:56,534
Be sure these two get good treatment.

650
01:32:06,462 --> 01:32:09,923
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

651
01:32:12,635 --> 01:32:14,094
Yeah.

652
01:32:17,014 --> 01:32:19,265
For the last time, Sergeant...

653
01:32:19,725 --> 01:32:23,937
I'm telling you, I want the prisoners
treated as prisoners.

654
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:26,564
No more brutality.

655
01:32:27,566 --> 01:32:31,236
There's hundreds of prisoners out there
and only a few men to guard them.

656
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,738
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.

657
01:32:33,823 --> 01:32:38,493
I think that you'll manage to gain
their respect by treating them better.

658
01:32:39,995 --> 01:32:42,622
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

659
01:32:42,706 --> 01:32:45,542
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

660
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:48,920
While I'm in charge here,
the prisoners are not to be tortured...

661
01:32:49,004 --> 01:32:52,048
or cheated or murdered.

662
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:54,843
That an accusation?

663
01:32:54,927 --> 01:33:00,223
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

664
01:33:00,724 --> 01:33:03,935
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

665
01:33:04,019 --> 01:33:07,313
I know there's scum around
who are bivouacked near the camp...

666
01:33:07,398 --> 01:33:10,608
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

667
01:33:10,693 --> 01:33:15,697
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

668
01:33:17,908 --> 01:33:19,492
Yes, sir...

669
01:33:19,577 --> 01:33:21,870
just as long as you're the commandant.

670
01:33:23,706 --> 01:33:25,123
Yes, Sergeant.

671
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:31,337
I know this leg means
I won't last very long...

672
01:33:31,422 --> 01:33:35,967
but I pray I can manage to have
enough time to amass evidence...

673
01:33:36,051 --> 01:33:38,303
and bring to a court-martial...

674
01:33:38,387 --> 01:33:40,972
all those who discredit and dishonor...

675
01:33:41,056 --> 01:33:43,725
the uniform of the Union.

676
01:33:48,898 --> 01:33:50,857
I wish you luck.

677
01:34:25,434 --> 01:34:28,603
You and the others better lay low
for a few days.

678
01:34:29,605 --> 01:34:33,024
No, I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

679
01:34:45,371 --> 01:34:47,622
- Bring me Carson.
- Right.

680
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:05,682
Listen, Angel Eyes said
for us to lay low for a few days...

681
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:09,185
but we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

682
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:10,812
Come on, saddle your horses.

683
01:35:11,522 --> 01:35:12,981
Get in.

684
01:35:21,991 --> 01:35:25,034
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.

685
01:35:26,328 --> 01:35:28,413
There's no formalities here.

686
01:35:39,842 --> 01:35:41,968
It's been a long time.

687
01:35:45,514 --> 01:35:48,850
You're hungry. Sit down, eat.

688
01:36:08,871 --> 01:36:10,955
I knew it, I knew it.

689
01:36:12,541 --> 01:36:15,793
The minute I saw you, I said to myself...

690
01:36:15,878 --> 01:36:18,296
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes.

691
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:22,050
"I'll bet he got himself an easy job...

692
01:36:25,429 --> 01:36:27,388
"and he never forgets a friend."

693
01:36:28,432 --> 01:36:30,600
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

694
01:36:33,062 --> 01:36:36,272
- Right.
- It's good to see old friends again.

695
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:39,525
Good.

696
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:43,071
Especially when they've come
from so far away...

697
01:36:43,155 --> 01:36:45,490
and have so much to talk about.

698
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:49,786
And you do have a lot
to talk about, haven't you?

699
01:36:52,331 --> 01:36:55,416
You were captured near Fort Craig.

700
01:37:00,297 --> 01:37:03,758
Well, if you were with Sibley,
that means then that you...

701
01:37:03,842 --> 01:37:06,010
were coming from Santa Fe.

702
01:37:18,273 --> 01:37:21,943
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Very hard.

703
01:37:23,862 --> 01:37:26,906
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

704
01:37:29,076 --> 01:37:32,412
Why are you going under the name
of Bill Carson now?

705
01:37:37,835 --> 01:37:40,503
One name is as good as another.

706
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:42,797
Not wise to use your own name.

707
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:47,093
Like you. I'll bet
they don't call you Angel Eyes.

708
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:49,887
Sergeant Angel Eyes.

709
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:02,066
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

710
01:38:02,151 --> 01:38:06,320
Music? Yes, it's very good...
very good for the digestion.

711
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,127
So...

712
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:24,714
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

713
01:38:30,345 --> 01:38:31,637
That fake too?

714
01:38:33,724 --> 01:38:36,058
Bill Carson's name's written in it.

715
01:38:37,853 --> 01:38:41,647
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

716
01:39:34,493 --> 01:39:37,077
More feeling.

717
01:40:17,576 --> 01:40:20,160
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

718
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:29,420
What'd he tell you about the money?

719
01:40:29,504 --> 01:40:31,630
I don't...

720
01:40:31,715 --> 01:40:35,175
I don't know what you're talking about.

721
01:41:00,108 --> 01:41:03,694
How's your digestion now?

722
01:41:06,373 --> 01:41:08,542
You'd better talk.

723
01:41:08,543 --> 01:41:12,129
I have nothing to tell you.

724
01:41:50,098 --> 01:41:53,684
Play that fiddle, you!

725
01:42:16,447 --> 01:42:20,033
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

726
01:42:20,118 --> 01:42:23,036
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

727
01:42:23,121 --> 01:42:26,123
So many of us have had a session in there.

728
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,250
Enough. Enough. I talk. I talk.

729
01:42:59,635 --> 01:43:01,761
What did he say about the money?

730
01:43:05,766 --> 01:43:08,226
It's buried in a grave.

731
01:43:09,603 --> 01:43:12,522
- Where?
- Sad Hill...

732
01:43:12,606 --> 01:43:15,066
Sad Hill Cemetery.

733
01:43:17,945 --> 01:43:19,320
Which grave?

734
01:43:20,364 --> 01:43:23,992
I don't know. I don't know, I tell you.

735
01:43:27,371 --> 01:43:29,622
Ask Blondie.

736
01:43:29,707 --> 01:43:32,584
He knows the name on the grave.

737
01:43:54,356 --> 01:43:56,316
Put those clothes on.

738
01:44:00,488 --> 01:44:03,907
- Why?
- We're going for a ride.

739
01:44:05,201 --> 01:44:08,661
- Where?
- To find $200,000.

740
01:44:09,705 --> 01:44:12,624
I know the name of the cemetery now...

741
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:15,293
and you know the name of the grave.

742
01:44:35,189 --> 01:44:38,191
You're not gonna give me
the same treatment?

743
01:44:42,029 --> 01:44:43,613
Would you talk?

744
01:44:44,698 --> 01:44:46,449
No, probably not.

745
01:44:48,285 --> 01:44:49,786
That's what I thought.

746
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:52,956
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco...

747
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,626
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

748
01:45:00,131 --> 01:45:03,174
And Tuco... is he...

749
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,680
Not yet.

750
01:45:08,764 --> 01:45:11,015
But he's in very good hands.

751
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:15,478
You've changed partners,
but you still got the same deal.

752
01:45:15,563 --> 01:45:18,189
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

753
01:45:19,525 --> 01:45:22,986
There's two of us. it should
make it easier than just one.

754
01:45:28,325 --> 01:45:29,576
Yeah.

755
01:45:49,638 --> 01:45:53,224
Hold it. That's it, don't move.

756
01:45:54,101 --> 01:45:57,729
Now don't breathe. Still. That's it.

757
01:45:59,773 --> 01:46:01,608
Got it. Thank you.

758
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:21,336
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

759
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:25,006
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

760
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:26,925
$3,000, friend.

761
01:46:27,009 --> 01:46:29,260
That's a lot of money for a head.

762
01:46:30,387 --> 01:46:33,640
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

763
01:46:39,521 --> 01:46:43,024
I told you once, friend,
if I ever get you down...

764
01:46:43,108 --> 01:46:46,319
you're gonna need a lot of help
to get up again.

765
01:47:05,923 --> 01:47:08,132
You're a lot luckier than that one.

766
01:47:08,217 --> 01:47:10,760
Grub, a rope, and you're all finished.

767
01:47:10,844 --> 01:47:13,554
And there isn't any partner this time to
shoot you down.

768
01:48:55,949 --> 01:48:58,193
If your friends stay out in the damp,

769
01:48:58,194 --> 01:49:01,037
they're liable to catch a cold,
aren't they?

770
01:49:01,121 --> 01:49:02,622
Or a bullet.

771
01:49:07,544 --> 01:49:09,629
Hear that, boys? Come on out here.

772
01:49:22,309 --> 01:49:25,686
Since we're all going in the same
direction, might as well go together.

773
01:49:26,939 --> 01:49:31,692
One, two, three, four,

774
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:34,404
five, six.

775
01:49:35,114 --> 01:49:37,990
Six... Perfect number.

776
01:49:39,576 --> 01:49:41,786
Isn't three the perfect number?

777
01:49:43,539 --> 01:49:46,666
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.

778
01:50:50,439 --> 01:50:53,357
Sure would like to put
your paw on it, huh?

779
01:50:55,319 --> 01:50:57,403
I would like to piss. It's rough.

780
01:50:57,488 --> 01:50:59,989
I've been shaken up on this train
nearly ten hours now.

781
01:51:00,073 --> 01:51:02,909
You smell like a pig already...

782
01:51:02,993 --> 01:51:05,495
but let's not try to make things any worse.

783
01:51:07,831 --> 01:51:09,415
Get going.

784
01:51:18,509 --> 01:51:20,843
I can't while you're watching me.

785
01:51:44,618 --> 01:51:47,203
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?

786
01:52:08,267 --> 01:52:11,686
You don't want to break our friendship,
huh? Well, I'll break it.

787
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:58,084
Halt.

788
01:53:59,544 --> 01:54:01,128
Take your places.

789
01:54:12,557 --> 01:54:13,933
Ready!

790
01:54:14,518 --> 01:54:16,602
Aim! Fire!

791
01:54:34,037 --> 01:54:36,163
Slim, take care of the horses.

792
01:58:52,712 --> 01:58:56,298
I've been looking for you for eight months.

793
01:58:56,383 --> 01:59:00,970
Whenever I should've had a gun
in my right hand, I thought of you.

794
01:59:01,054 --> 01:59:04,974
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

795
01:59:05,058 --> 01:59:08,727
I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

796
01:59:24,786 --> 01:59:27,746
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

797
01:59:31,001 --> 01:59:33,585
Every gun makes its own tune.

798
01:59:34,587 --> 01:59:36,588
It's perfect timing, Large One.

799
01:59:54,899 --> 01:59:57,109
Clem, follow him.

800
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,044
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

801
02:00:57,128 --> 02:01:00,839
Just give me a little time
to get dressed, and I'll open up.

802
02:01:21,319 --> 02:01:24,029
Put your drawers on and take your gun off.

803
02:01:37,168 --> 02:01:39,878
How the hell did you get out
of that pigsty?

804
02:01:41,297 --> 02:01:45,092
My own way. I'm here
with your old friend, Angel Eyes.

805
02:01:46,177 --> 02:01:49,221
You talked, you traitor. You talked.

806
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:51,598
No, I didn't talk.

807
02:01:52,267 --> 02:01:54,726
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.

808
02:01:56,104 --> 02:01:58,230
You, me...

809
02:01:59,190 --> 02:02:01,692
So only you know your half of the secret?

810
02:02:08,783 --> 02:02:11,160
I'm very happy you're working with me...

811
02:02:11,244 --> 02:02:13,162
and we're together again.

812
02:02:13,246 --> 02:02:15,497
I get dressed,
I kill him and be right back.

813
02:02:15,582 --> 02:02:17,249
Oh, listen...

814
02:02:17,333 --> 02:02:19,209
I forgot to mention...

815
02:02:21,087 --> 02:02:23,714
He's not alone. There's five of them.

816
02:02:26,134 --> 02:02:28,760
- Five?
- Yeah, five of them.

817
02:02:31,848 --> 02:02:34,266
So that's why you came to Tuco?

818
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,855
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

819
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:54,036
They shot him at close range.

820
02:03:13,598 --> 02:03:15,724
Well, look who's here.

821
02:03:15,808 --> 02:03:17,976
The other one will be along.

822
02:03:20,521 --> 02:03:22,731
They'll come looking for us.

823
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:25,567
Watch out.

824
02:03:26,653 --> 02:03:28,278
There's two of them.

825
02:03:29,656 --> 02:03:31,782
I want that blond alive.

826
02:03:40,583 --> 02:03:44,002
You, back there. Come on, let's go.

827
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:20,289
Were you gonna die alone?

828
02:06:11,192 --> 02:06:12,317
Halt!

829
02:06:38,594 --> 02:06:41,763
- Angel Eyes is mine, huh?
- All right.

830
02:07:21,345 --> 02:07:23,430
"See you soon..."

831
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:27,559
"Idiots."

832
02:07:28,728 --> 02:07:30,228
It's for you.

833
02:07:55,171 --> 02:07:58,173
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

834
02:07:58,257 --> 02:08:00,550
Like a cemetery, for instance?

835
02:08:02,053 --> 02:08:05,013
There should be a bridge across that river.

836
02:08:05,097 --> 02:08:08,350
- We'd better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.

837
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:13,522
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

838
02:08:13,606 --> 02:08:17,484
Tuco has taken you this far.
I will take you all the way...

839
02:08:17,568 --> 02:08:19,110
Gentlemen.

840
02:08:22,615 --> 02:08:24,449
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

841
02:08:25,785 --> 02:08:27,702
Come along now. Follow me.

842
02:09:14,917 --> 02:09:17,335
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

843
02:09:31,976 --> 02:09:35,562
- Where do you hail from?
- Illinois.

844
02:09:38,149 --> 02:09:41,693
- And you?
- I'm with him.

845
02:09:48,034 --> 02:09:50,410
Any reason for being around here?

846
02:09:51,329 --> 02:09:53,705
We want to enlist, General.

847
02:09:56,709 --> 02:09:59,210
You better learn to distinguish rank.

848
02:09:59,295 --> 02:10:01,004
I'm a captain.

849
02:10:02,673 --> 02:10:04,299
Get the hell out.

850
02:10:05,885 --> 02:10:08,970
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

851
02:10:09,055 --> 02:10:10,388
Yes, sir.

852
02:10:15,436 --> 02:10:17,520
So you want to enlist?

853
02:10:18,564 --> 02:10:21,191
You gotta take a test to prove it.

854
02:10:30,326 --> 02:10:31,910
Well, show me.

855
02:10:55,768 --> 02:11:00,063
You've got a career. At the least,
I'd say you'll make colonel.

856
02:11:00,147 --> 02:11:01,815
- Really?
- Sure.

857
02:11:02,942 --> 02:11:05,110
Like it says in the manual...

858
02:11:05,194 --> 02:11:06,736
"You've got every qualification...

859
02:11:06,821 --> 02:11:09,447
"to become an expert
in the use of weapons."

860
02:11:10,741 --> 02:11:14,911
For this, sir,
is the most potent weapon in war.

861
02:11:17,748 --> 02:11:20,166
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

862
02:11:22,253 --> 02:11:23,753
Volunteers.

863
02:11:25,965 --> 02:11:27,757
You want to enlist, hmm?

864
02:11:29,301 --> 02:11:30,719
Let's go.

865
02:11:30,803 --> 02:11:32,762
Come on, gentlemen. Come on.

866
02:11:35,391 --> 02:11:38,393
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're still in time.

867
02:11:54,326 --> 02:11:56,619
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

868
02:11:56,704 --> 02:12:00,206
and send them to be slaughtered...
is the winner.

869
02:12:01,167 --> 02:12:05,962
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

870
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,966
All of us reek of alcohol.

871
02:12:18,017 --> 02:12:20,143
What did you say your name was?

872
02:12:22,855 --> 02:12:24,147
And you?

873
02:12:27,485 --> 02:12:28,485
No.

874
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:35,867
Names don't matter.

875
02:12:36,702 --> 02:12:41,080
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branson Bridge.

876
02:12:42,666 --> 02:12:46,336
- We have two attacks a day.
- Two attacks a day?

877
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:49,964
Sure, the Rebs have decided
that damn bridge...

878
02:12:50,049 --> 02:12:52,801
is the key to this whole area.

879
02:12:52,885 --> 02:12:56,012
Stupid, useless bridge.

880
02:12:56,096 --> 02:12:58,723
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

881
02:13:00,434 --> 02:13:05,230
And headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...

882
02:13:06,941 --> 02:13:09,025
even if all of us are killed.

883
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:11,319
Otherwise, the key will get rusty...

884
02:13:11,403 --> 02:13:13,404
and just be a spot on the wall.

885
02:13:14,907 --> 02:13:16,574
And that's not all.

886
02:13:16,909 --> 02:13:19,494
Both sides want the bridge intact.

887
02:13:19,578 --> 02:13:21,871
Intact is how the South wants it...

888
02:13:21,956 --> 02:13:23,998
and we want it intact too.

889
02:13:26,752 --> 02:13:28,795
You'll all turn to dust...

890
02:13:28,879 --> 02:13:31,172
but one thing is sure, boys:

891
02:13:31,257 --> 02:13:33,967
Branson Bridge will stand unbroken.

892
02:13:35,511 --> 02:13:39,597
Is it bad to speak the way I do
to volunteers?

893
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:42,767
I've done a lot worse.

894
02:13:47,356 --> 02:13:50,608
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

895
02:13:51,944 --> 02:13:54,904
In here, I've destroyed it all.

896
02:13:56,115 --> 02:13:58,032
It's a court-martial offense to imagine...

897
02:13:58,117 --> 02:14:01,119
to dream of blowing it up...
a serious crime.

898
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:05,707
Even to think of destroying
that bridge is just...

899
02:14:08,627 --> 02:14:10,962
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

900
02:14:12,464 --> 02:14:15,216
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

901
02:14:19,305 --> 02:14:21,389
I've been dreaming about it.

902
02:14:25,102 --> 02:14:27,020
I've even worked out a plan.

903
02:14:28,772 --> 02:14:30,148
I sure have.

904
02:14:31,483 --> 02:14:34,611
The best time is after the attack...

905
02:14:34,695 --> 02:14:37,447
when there's a truce to get the wounded.

906
02:14:38,574 --> 02:14:40,283
If I could do it...

907
02:14:40,743 --> 02:14:43,161
I could save many thousands of men.

908
02:14:48,834 --> 02:14:51,002
But what I lack is the guts.

909
02:14:57,009 --> 02:15:00,136
They're beginning their daily slaughter
right on time.

910
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:03,765
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

911
02:15:03,849 --> 02:15:05,433
Be right there.

912
02:15:18,864 --> 02:15:20,198
Let's go.

913
02:15:21,241 --> 02:15:22,992
All right, friends...

914
02:15:23,077 --> 02:15:25,620
come along and enjoy the spectacle.

915
02:15:56,735 --> 02:15:59,362
Companies, report!

916
02:15:59,446 --> 02:16:02,365
Company B ready!

917
02:16:02,449 --> 02:16:05,076
Company E ready!

918
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:07,203
Company D ready!

919
02:16:13,043 --> 02:16:16,212
Companies, forward!

920
02:16:38,861 --> 02:16:41,696
It looks like the captain is
really asking for a bullet in his guts.

921
02:16:41,780 --> 02:16:42,947
Yeah.

922
02:17:36,418 --> 02:17:39,337
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

923
02:18:00,067 --> 02:18:03,694
I have a feeling it's really
gonna be a good long battle.

924
02:18:07,866 --> 02:18:10,118
- Blondie?
- Huh?

925
02:18:10,202 --> 02:18:14,122
The money's on the other side of the river.

926
02:18:14,206 --> 02:18:15,414
Where?

927
02:18:18,043 --> 02:18:21,212
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

928
02:18:22,089 --> 02:18:25,758
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

929
02:18:26,802 --> 02:18:30,471
What would happen if somebody were
to blow up that bridge?

930
02:18:32,182 --> 02:18:33,307
Yeah.

931
02:18:34,393 --> 02:18:37,687
Then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight.

932
02:18:38,021 --> 02:18:39,230
Maybe.

933
02:19:17,269 --> 02:19:19,812
Doctor, quick, the captain's wounded.

934
02:19:22,566 --> 02:19:24,317
Hurry, a stretcher.

935
02:19:26,737 --> 02:19:28,279
Easy. Easy now.

936
02:19:39,291 --> 02:19:40,958
Get things ready.

937
02:20:01,855 --> 02:20:03,981
A little of this will help.

938
02:20:10,322 --> 02:20:12,865
Take a slug of this, Captain.

939
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:14,742
Keep your ears open.

940
02:21:03,625 --> 02:21:06,252
What are you doing? No, leave me alone.

941
02:22:47,479 --> 02:22:50,356
You realize we might be risking our lives.

942
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:52,691
Yeah, and if I get killed...

943
02:22:52,776 --> 02:22:56,153
you'll never get your hands
on all that beautiful money.

944
02:22:56,238 --> 02:22:57,738
Yeah, Tuco...

945
02:22:58,990 --> 02:23:00,991
it sure would be a pity.

946
02:23:31,398 --> 02:23:32,523
Doc.

947
02:23:34,651 --> 02:23:35,943
Doctor...

948
02:23:36,778 --> 02:23:39,572
could you help me live a little more?

949
02:23:39,656 --> 02:23:41,407
I expect good news.

950
02:24:32,417 --> 02:24:35,753
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

951
02:24:35,837 --> 02:24:39,924
- Why don't we?
- Huh? You go first.

952
02:24:42,969 --> 02:24:45,554
No, I think it's better that...

953
02:24:47,933 --> 02:24:49,266
you start.

954
02:24:53,605 --> 02:24:54,939
All right.

955
02:24:57,317 --> 02:24:59,401
The name of the cemetery is...

956
02:25:17,587 --> 02:25:19,713
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

957
02:25:28,014 --> 02:25:30,558
The name on the grave is...

958
02:25:34,479 --> 02:25:35,980
Arch Stanton.

959
02:25:38,108 --> 02:25:40,943
Arch Stanton? Are you sure?

960
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:44,113
Yeah, sure, I'm sure.

961
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:35,115
It'll be a lot easier with that.

962
02:38:15,406 --> 02:38:18,283
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

963
02:38:18,367 --> 02:38:19,451
Dig.

964
02:38:22,496 --> 02:38:24,247
You're not digging.

965
02:38:36,385 --> 02:38:39,679
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

966
02:38:41,849 --> 02:38:42,932
Why?

967
02:38:45,936 --> 02:38:47,604
I'll tell you why.

968
02:38:48,731 --> 02:38:51,107
'Cause there's nothing in there.

969
02:38:59,158 --> 02:39:00,617
Why, you son of a...

970
02:39:00,701 --> 02:39:02,786
You thought I'd trust you?

971
02:39:05,831 --> 02:39:07,999
$200,000 is a lot of money.

972
02:39:09,835 --> 02:39:12,003
We're gonna have to earn it.

973
02:39:15,299 --> 02:39:16,383
How?

974
02:39:27,937 --> 02:39:30,480
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

975
02:39:34,610 --> 02:39:35,860
The gun.

976
02:45:42,519 --> 02:45:46,230
You pig. You want to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?

977
02:45:48,358 --> 02:45:49,776
Last night.

978
02:45:50,903 --> 02:45:55,615
You see, in this world, there's
two kinds of people, my friend...

979
02:45:55,699 --> 02:45:57,825
those with loaded guns...

980
02:45:57,910 --> 02:46:00,286
and those who dig.

981
02:46:00,370 --> 02:46:02,747
- You dig.
- Where?

982
02:46:14,259 --> 02:46:15,384
Here.

983
02:46:19,765 --> 02:46:21,641
There's no name on it!

984
02:46:22,893 --> 02:46:25,061
There's no name here either.

985
02:46:26,730 --> 02:46:29,565
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

986
02:46:29,650 --> 02:46:31,484
It was the grave marked "Unknown"...

987
02:46:31,568 --> 02:46:33,611
right beside Arch Stanton.

988
02:46:41,370 --> 02:46:42,954
Go ahead.

989
02:47:40,804 --> 02:47:43,347
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!

990
02:48:00,282 --> 02:48:04,243
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't
play a joke on me like that.

991
02:48:05,621 --> 02:48:07,955
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

992
02:48:08,707 --> 02:48:12,710
Now I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

993
02:49:19,361 --> 02:49:23,447
Well, now, seems just like old times.

994
02:49:27,828 --> 02:49:29,745
Four for you...

995
02:49:31,415 --> 02:49:32,999
and four...

996
02:49:36,253 --> 02:49:37,670
four for me.

997
02:50:20,284 --> 02:50:22,614
Blondie!

998
02:52:42,301 --> 02:52:43,843
Hey, Blondie!

999
02:52:45,888 --> 02:52:49,182
You know what you are?

1000
02:52:52,394 --> 02:52:55,521
Just a dirty son of a bitch!

1001
02:52:56,305 --> 02:53:02,852
