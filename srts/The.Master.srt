1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,765
Ah, you know what?
Just remind me.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,067
I got to write a thank-you note
to the guy who invented waffles.

3
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:09,482
The recipe first appeared
in <i>Le Ménagier de Paris,</i> a book

4
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:12,018
a husband wrote for his wife
in the 14th century.

5
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:14,487
Since he's dead,
a note would be pointless.

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:17,490
I pity the men who aren't
married to you, Bones.

7
00:00:17,524 --> 00:00:19,359
Booth, did you see
what Christine brought home

8
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:20,593
from preschool?

9
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:22,061
Hey, look at
that, huh?

10
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:24,464
15th place winner
in an egg race. Huh.

11
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:26,632
Our little girl's
a champion.

12
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,135
Booth, there are only
15 children in the class.

13
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,603
What do you want me to do?

14
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:32,372
Get her a trainer
so we could work her harder?

15
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,440
If she's 15th,
that means that she lost.

16
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,976
Children need to understand
what losing means.

17
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,911
It's an egg race.

18
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,280
When I was a child,
I played blackjack with Max,

19
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:42,682
and he never let me win.

20
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,117
I lost my allowance,

21
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:46,019
but I got a realistic view
of the world.

22
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,453
Your dad took your allowance?

23
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,856
Won it. Actually,
he won the marker he gave me

24
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,392
that said he owed me the allowance.
I don't think

25
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:54,394
we should use your father as
an example here. It's not...

26
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:56,062
Oh. Brennan.

27
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,498
Okay, I'm on my way.
Wait. Wait. Wait a second.

28
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:00,700
What about the waffle I just made you?
Sorry.

29
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,168
A body's on its way to the lab.

30
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:03,836
More for you.
I'll call if it concerns you.

31
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:07,040
I got waffles flying
all over the place here.

32
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:10,743
That's hot. That's hot.

33
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:16,049
The remains are
in the pig troughs?

34
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,652
Yes. I am setting up
a filtration system

35
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:22,755
that will allow us to separate
liquid in the pig slop

36
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,191
from any human remains,

37
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:28,428
such as tissue,
bones, organs...

38
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:30,963
But you're not waiting.
I was told

39
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:33,833
the body was dumped
on a pig farm in Virginia.

40
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,368
Yeah.

41
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:37,870
So the noise of the pigs feeding
woke up the farmer,

42
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:39,639
so he was able to stop them

43
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,641
before they finished eating
all the human remains.

44
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,443
I need an intern.
Where's Oliver Wells?

45
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:45,278
Out of town on family business.

46
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:48,114
Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins,
you remember Dr. Filmore?

47
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:49,749
It's our favorite Canadian

48
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:51,484
forensic podiatrist.

49
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:53,119
Hello, Dr. Hodgins.

50
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:54,787
Dr. Brennan, it's a pleasure
to be working with you again.

51
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,457
I'm afraid there will be
no pleasure, Dr. Filmore.

52
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,325
His field is forensic podiatry.

53
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,061
Dr. Filmore is writing a report

54
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,796
at the request
of the FBI

55
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,431
and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police

56
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:08,101
on cooperation between
the United States and Canada

57
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:09,936
in the field of
forensic sciences.

58
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,038
It's the first trans-border
study in forensic cooperation

59
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:13,739
between our two
great nations.

60
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:15,141
No. I can't allow that.

61
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:17,210
We're in the middle
of an investigation.

62
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:19,278
Hmm.

63
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,447
What are you doing?

64
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,949
Notes for my report.

65
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:25,318
"Check American definition
of 'cooperation.'"

66
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:26,953
Dr. Filmore

67
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:28,588
will be your intern so he can

68
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,956
observe firsthand that

69
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,425
our definition
of cooperation is the same

70
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,759
as our neighbors to the north.

71
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:35,261
By his own admission,

72
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:37,263
he's familiar with only 25%

73
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,398
of the bones in the human body.

74
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,135
Actually, I just completed
my PhD in forensic anthropology,

75
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:45,505
so I am now fully qualified
to work with you...

76
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,340
as a peer.

77
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:51,110
Then that settles it.

78
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,045
Now, if you'll
excuse me.

79
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,647
Put on some gloves.

80
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,083
We're looking for human remains
in these troughs.

81
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:58,851
We might not be able to recover

82
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,286
a complete
skeleton because...

83
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,221
Because pigs eat human bones.

84
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:04,323
I grew up
on a farm in Manitoba.

85
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:13,366
Angela...

86
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,469
Oh, hey. I can't do anything
until I have a skull,

87
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,738
so I thought I'd just
create something alive.

88
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:20,339
Not why I'm here.

89
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,742
It's, uh...

90
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:24,544
<i>Science Monthly</i>
just contacted me

91
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:27,180
about their Outstanding Women
of Science issue.

92
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:28,981
Oh. Brennan again?

93
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:31,851
No. Me.

94
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:34,487
They want me this year.

95
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,857
Oh, my God!
Cam, that's fantastic!

96
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,759
Congratulations!

97
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,228
I should be happy,
but I just feel uncomfortable.

98
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:44,931
Brennan?

99
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:48,501
Yeah. She can sometimes feel...

100
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,503
I don't know how to say it.

101
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:52,672
That all awards
should go to her?

102
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,907
And I don't really care.

103
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:56,542
I could just
tell the magazine no.

104
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:58,444
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

105
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,846
This is...
this is a huge honor,

106
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,915
and we're all going
to celebrate this,

107
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,550
including Brennan.

108
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,452
You have to
enjoy this.

109
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:09,755
Smile. You deserve it.

110
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,629
Aah. This will be easier.

111
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:18,130
So, the pump
creates suction

112
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,466
and delivers the contents
of the troughs into this

113
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,535
sluice box,
which will separate liquid

114
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,037
from particulates greater than
.03 millimeters.

115
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:26,706
Quite the impressive
contrivance, Dr. Hodgins.

116
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,407
Right? All right.

117
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,575
Here we go.

118
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:34,580
- Yeah!
- Oh!

119
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,215
It appears to working.

120
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,283
You know, this death

121
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,751
might just be an accident.

122
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,219
We had a farmhand

123
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:41,520
who fell into the trough after

124
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,256
drinking to excess.
The pigs must have

125
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,491
thought he was delicious,
because there was nothing left.

126
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,093
Well, considering
this person was

127
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,662
dismembered, I would
rule out an accident.

128
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:51,397
Yes.

129
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,335
Oh. Ah.

130
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,704
Dark brown hair.
Definitely human.

131
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,439
Well, the greater

132
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,575
sciatic notch indicates a male.

133
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,011
The auricular surface indicates
an age range

134
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:07,013
between 29 and 35.

135
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:08,914
Huh. A central incisor.

136
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,751
Not in any way connected
with the foot, of course.

137
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:15,321
This spatula shape indicates
the victim was Caucasian.

138
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:17,990
Told you it would work, huh?

139
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:22,728
Well,

140
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:24,330
it's not the filter.

141
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:25,398
Can you hold that?
Yes.

142
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:26,499
It's got to be

143
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,768
the hose.

144
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,403
Hey. Good news.

145
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:32,638
Cam got a call from
<i>Science Monthly.</i>

146
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:34,006
They announced this year's

147
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,875
Outstanding Women
of Science award.

148
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,243
Why did they call Cam?

149
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:38,757
Why didn't they just
call me directly?

150
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:42,948
Because Cam is getting
the award, sweetie.

151
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:44,784
Wow!

152
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:47,153
That's great.
Yes, I'm very happy for her.

153
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:49,689
And you're happy
for her, too, Brennan.

154
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:51,357
Very happy.

155
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:52,992
Because she's your friend.

156
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:54,760
Yes.

157
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:57,830
Just the-the descriptor
is "outstanding."

158
00:05:57,864 --> 00:06:00,599
All right, we're all good to go.

159
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:01,867
You know, <i>Science Monthly</i> is

160
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:04,370
an exceptional mag...
Oh! My.

161
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:07,907
Don't move,

162
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,908
Dr. Filmore.

163
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:10,343
You're covered in evidence.

164
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:11,944
It's no problem.

165
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:14,146
Just like being
back on the farm.

166
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:16,849
Oh, here's a piece...

167
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:19,151
Thank you.
...that's important.

A foot is not necessarily

174
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,851
the solution
to this forensic puzzle.

175

I see you haven't
lost your conviction

that you have
all the answers.

Well, I am outstanding
and without peer in my field.

178
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:11,959
I assume that is why

179
00:07:11,994 --> 00:07:14,395
your government wanted
you to observe me.

What are you
writing now?

181
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:21,636
Oh, just an observation
that Americans are hubristic,

182
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,604
and Canadians must deal
with this challenge

183
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,939
in future cooperative ventures.

184
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:27,709
Facts are not
hubris, Dr. Filmore.

185
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:32,231
The left side of the frontal
bone, including the supraorbital

186
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:34,333
foramen, as well as the maxilla,

187
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,001
and the right zygomatic
are all missing.

188
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:39,104
Facial reconstruction would
prove difficult for Angela.

189
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,941
It appears there's a fracture
on the occipital,

190
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,276
and avulsion fractures
on the left mastoid process.

191
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:46,712
Confirming that
a hit and tear

192
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:49,081
from the occipital
to the mastoid

193
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:51,217
as a possible
cause of death.

194
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:53,819
Hey. So, the hair sample
carried traces

195
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:56,422
of beeswax and hempseed oil.

196
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,824
Think our victim had dreadlocks.
Victim had blonde hair.

197
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:01,327
That dark brown hair
could belong to the killer.

198
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,728
All right, well,

199
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:04,897
Cam's running a DNA
on both samples,

200
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,233
but I also found traces
of chestnuts

201
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,101
imbedded on
the victim's clothing.

202
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,569
You know,

203
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,638
at our farm,
when the pigs wouldn't eat,

204
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,474
my father used to sweeten
the slop with chestnuts.

205
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,444
So it's possible the killer
knew how to get the pigs

206
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,179
to devour the victim.

207
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:21,914
Yes.

208
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,283
<i>Hey, Sweets,</i>

209
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,252
got the DNA results
from the hair the squints found

210
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,686
in the pig slop.

211
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,088
Jarrick Henry.

212
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:31,590
Who?
Jarrick Henry.

213
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,360
Oh, right.
He's the guy who fed

214
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,729
his victim to pigs,
right? Nice fella.

215
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,831
Yeah, and with no body,
the lawyer got an acquittal.

216
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,900
Didn't think
he'd pull that M.O. twice.

217
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:43,102
You mean feed another
victim to pigs?

218
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,603
He's a high-risk
repeat offender.

219
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:46,105
He got away with it once.

220
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,806
Probably figured he could
get away with it again.

221
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,042
<i>You felt the honor</i>

222
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,777
from <i>Science Monthly</i>
should go to you, eh?

223
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:54,013
It's called "Outstanding
Women of Science."

224
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,382
I have the utmost
respect for Dr. Saroyan.

225
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,819
I can only surmise the editorial
staff consists of laymen.

226
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,556
You know, in Canada,
we have a saying.

227
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,491
"Wait your turn.

228
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,226
"If you are truly deserving,

229
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,094
an honor will eventually
come to you."

230
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,298
That's why I don't
live in Canada.

231
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:13,732
There are striations
that indicate

232
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,134
a reciprocating saw was used

233
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:16,969
to sever the head of the femur.

234
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:18,537
And here,

235
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,039
the same striations.

236
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:21,473
There are false-start

237
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,808
kerf marks on this radius.

238
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,044
The blade broke.
And here,

239
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,246
the striations
from the new blade.

240
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,081
So the killer used
a reciprocating saw

241
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:30,482
to cut up the body.

242
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:31,817
You know, that moment there

243
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:33,519
where we were working together
seamlessly

244
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,220
in true harmony
and cooperation--

245
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:38,524
it was... almost Canadian.

246
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,827
You should write <i>that</i>
in your little book.

247
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,566
<i>We found the saw</i>

248
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:50,202
in your garage-- the one
you used to cut up the victim.

249
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:52,504
Ballistic fingerprinting for
a saw blade? I don't think so.

250
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:55,341
You also broke the blade
when you were cutting him up,

251
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,409
smart guy.
See, that <i>does</i>

252
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:59,078
leave a fingerprint on the bone.

253
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,814
Look, okay, I'm being set up,
all right?

254
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:05,117
Somebody tossed a dead guy
over the wall into my backyard.

255
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:07,086
I didn't even know him.

256
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,887
I'm confused.
Why didn't you call the cops

257
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,322
when this dead body
showed up?

258
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,124
Come on, man.
If I reported him to the cops,

259
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,926
I'd be their number one suspect.
No, no, no, no, no.

260
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,729
<i>Now</i> you're
the number one suspect.

261
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:18,263
We have your DNA
on the victim.

262
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,865
We also got you
for illegal disposal

263
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,234
of human remains...
I didn't kill him.

264
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,669
It's the dreads, baby.

265
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:24,903
You're shedding
like a husky in the summer.

266
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,639
You got away
with it last time.

267
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:28,040
You're not getting away
with it this time.

268
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,341
Wait, wait, wait.
You never mentioned

269
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:30,743
the name of the dead guy.

270
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,214
And I'm thinking
that's 'cause you don't know.

271
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,549
Yeah.

272
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:39,051
I got that right.

273
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,020
Listen, all right,
I didn't kill him.

274
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:43,622
All I did was feed
his body to the pigs.

275
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:46,625
But I saw his face
before those pigs ate it.

276
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,294
I can get you
a description.

277
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,465
So...

278
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,368
you ready to deal, G-Man?

279
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,709
So, labs came back negative--
there was no blood found

280
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:05,678
in Jarrick's trunk.
Well, he was meticulous.

281
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,513
He was careful not to
bleach the saw blades,

282
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:09,187
so he probably used
plastic sheets, right?

283
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:11,583
No. Guy-- he's got no motive.
Forget him, okay?

284
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:13,786
But Angela got an I.D.

285
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,121
based on Jarrick Henry's
description.

286
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,623
Oh, my God.

287
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,992
You know him?
That's Albert Magnuson.

288
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:21,393
The chess guy?

289
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,262
Anyone who knows chess
knows Albert Magnuson.

290
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,564
I used to be a serious
chess player, till college.

291
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:28,233
Then I became a little obsessed,
had to give it up.

292
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:31,103
But Albert's a genius,
brilliant.

293
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,905
Turns out, Magnuson was
bringing in some serious cash.

294
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,807
Angela found out
this information.

295
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,709
Check out
the Web site here, huh?

296
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:38,143
Your chess champion--

297
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:40,446
he was bringing in
some serious merchandise.

298
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,114
And there's some big
companies thought they could

299
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:43,315
cash in if chess

300
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,483
made it into the Olympics.

301
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,251
They were buying the master.
Yeah.

302
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,654
But all the names
and likeness of Albert Magnuson,

303
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,889
all the merchandizing
and the sponsorship--

304
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:53,625
that just goes
to Levitt Holdings.

305
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,027
All right, so?

306
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,563
There's only one chief officer

307
00:11:57,597 --> 00:12:00,299
of Levitt Holdings--
Suzanne Levitt.

308
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,735
Oh, and with Magnuson gone, she
gets to keep all of his money.

309
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,537
Right. I'm bringing her in.

310
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,567
I can't believe this.

311
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:12,808
Who would
murder Albert?

312
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,182
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

313
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,701
When was the last time
you saw him?

314
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,135
Two days ago.

315
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,171
We had lunch,
then he went to the chess club,

316
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:22,106
and I-I didn't
see him after that.

317
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,507
Your relationship with Albert

318
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,509
wasn't just business
though, was it?

319
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,612
He lived with me
and my son Tim.

320
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,681
We were going to be married.

321
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,918
In going over his life, we've
red-flagged a couple of issues

322
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,619
regarding his finances;
you controlled

323
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,822
all of the finances, right?
All of it.

324
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:40,157
Well, all Albert wanted to do
was play chess.

325
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,326
You're saying it was
out of concern for Albert

326
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,361
that you controlled
all of his money?

327
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,297
I didn't kill Albert.

328
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,065
I loved him.

329
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,034
And you made him
all of his money.

330
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,235
Right. Magnuson
chess boards,

331
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,904
TV appearances,
chess retreats...

332
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,573
I had a background
in marketing;

333
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,341
why shouldn't Albert
capitalize on his talent?

334
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,876
And where were you
two nights ago?

335
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,579
Home. Alone.

336
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,814
And unless my cat can talk,

337
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,783
I have no alibi.

338
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,085
But you should really be talking
to Albert's ex-wife.

339
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,854
She hated him.

340
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:12,490
She burned down his apartment.

341
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,395
<i>So, Magnuson's ex-wife Ingrid</i>

342
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,865
is a member
of the Dutch Reformed Church.

343
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,400
He wasn't; that caused
the couple to drift apart.

344
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,703
Well, it's a very
strict religious sect.

345
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:28,272
Right. Well, you know, she was
here on a visitor's visa.

346
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,142
It expired and...
it was never surrendered.

347
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:33,744
She's living under the radar;
she'll be hard to find.

348
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,946
We'll find her.
We will find her.

349
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,016
Booth, do you think
I'm being small-minded

350
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,819
about Cam getting
the award and not me?

351
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,788
Yes.

352
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,089
What?

353
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:46,323
You might want another answer,

354
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,825
but I can't give that to you.

355
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,261
But I'm clearly
the best scientist.

356
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,930
And are you a worse scientist
because Cam's getting the award?

357
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,331
Of course not.
See?

358
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,666
Yeah. So you're just being petty

359
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,934
because you want to win.

360
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:59,303
I thought you would
take my side.

361
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,105
I am on your side, okay?

362
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,873
I'm on your better side.

363
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,974
Huh?

364
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,810
Much better side.
Oh, hey.

365
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,077
Hey, guys.
Yeah.

366
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,345
So, I called
the Mayfair Chess Club

367
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,713
where Magnuson was last seen.

368
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,982
I know some people there
from my chess days.

369
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,119
Apparently, Magnuson had a lot
of enemies in the chess club.

370
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,255
You think that the killer
could be a chess player?

371
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,824
Yeah, I think
it's very possible.

372
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,059
The killer did use Jarrick
to dispose of the body,

373
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,261
basically sacrificing him
like a chess piece, right?

374
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,630
There's a strong connection
between chess and the logic

375
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,133
and forethought needed
to plan and execute a murder.

376
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,734
Look, I'll tell you what,
why don't you go

377
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,469
to the chess club
and see what you can dig up.

378
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,405
So you're saying that
I'm the lead on the case?

379
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,807
No. You're the...
chess nerd on the case.

380
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,577
Lead chess nerd--
good enough for me.

382
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,854
Hey.

383
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,089
Guess I shouldn't
be surprised to see you here.

384
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:53,991
Dr. Sweets,
this is my son Tim.

385
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,161
Y-You're investigating
Albert's murder, aren't you?

386
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,830
Do me a favor,
keep it on the down low.

387
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,299
- Sure.
- I have to go, Tim.

388
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,701
Call me when you're done?

389
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,369
Yeah.

390
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,042
You don't drive?

391
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,945
Uh, Mom's been trying
to spend more time with me.

392
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,614
Especially since... you know.

393
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:17,615
Mm-hmm.

394
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,083
Were you and Albert close?

395
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:20,851
My mom met Albert through me.

396
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,853
He was kind of my mentor here.

397
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,089
Like-like a second father to me.

398
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,290
Right.

399
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:27,491
Sweets!

400
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,493
Hey, Romanov,
good to see you.

401
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,395
You have been
conspicuously absent

402
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,330
for the past decade.

403
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,733
Whoa, Sweets! Hi, Lance!
Hey, guys.

404
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,970
These-these guys know you?

405
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,606
Ten years ago, Sweets was one
of the youngest chess masters

406
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,874
in the federation.

407
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:44,775
Brilliant.

408
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:45,809
Yeah, I'm probably

409
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,111
very rusty at this point.

410
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,646
Ah, I think not.

411
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,547
Remember the old Russian saying:

412
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,616
"You cannot drink
your glass away."

413
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,318
I look forward
to sitting

414
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:56,120
opposite you again, Sweets.

415
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,554
You want to
show me around?

416
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,089
Sure.

417
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,292
Um...

418
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,339
You <i>are</i> good.

419
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,041
Yeah, good and rusty.

420
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:20,010
I'd like to be
as rusty as you are.

421
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,745
Sorry about Magnuson, son.

422
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,881
I hope he didn't misinterpret me
the last time we spoke.

423
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:27,584
No, sir, it was very clear
how you felt.

424
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,153
Seems like a lot
of people here

425
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:30,654
had an issue with Mr. Magnuson.

426
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,956
Sweets, right?

427
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,024
Dimitri told me about you.

428
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,559
Magnuson was

429
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:37,094
a good player.

430
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:38,495
Great, even.

431
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,763
But?

432
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,231
But nothing.

433
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,566
Mr. Wakefield
used to be my teacher.

434
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,269
And then you started
studying with Albert.

435
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,804
Before you jump
to ugly conclusions,

436
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,340
I never liked Albert, true,
but I was with Tim

437
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,541
when it happened.

438
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,209
At the deli.

439
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:54,745
I wasn't accusing you
of anything.

440
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,414
I'm sorry for your loss, Tim.

441
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,316
If you need
my help again,

442
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,552
just let me know.

443
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,729
Magnuson was last
seen headed here.

444
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,397
His parking's spot
somewhere over there.

445
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,599
Where, in the dark?

446
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,536
Lights are broken.

447
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,838
Any suspects

448
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:22,473
at the chess club?
Well,

449
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,475
you know, like a lot
of brilliant people,

450
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,745
Magnuson had a huge ego,
left little room for others.

451
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,782
Ah. So no one was, uh,
mourning his loss.

452
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,917
Oh... look at that.

453
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,553
Broken glass.

454
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,089
Ah.

455
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,891
Light's broken.

456
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:42,559
Hold up.

457
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,461
Broken lights
all over the place.

458
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,031
A good place
for an ambush.

459
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:50,367
Lot of water on the ground here;
must be a busted pipe.

460
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,835
Yep, there it is.

461
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,510
Security camera--
hopefully it's infrared.

462
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:54,972
Could be our lucky day.

463
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,573
Get some
footage off it.

464
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,243
Found his parking spot.

465
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:02,446
Look at that.

466
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,381
Blood.

467
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,117
This is where Magnuson
was killed.

468
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:14,832
I've got more blood

469
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,934
over here.
Impact hit?

470
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:18,436
Probably.

471
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,905
Spatter pattern looks
like someone may have

472
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:24,409
smashed the victim's head
against the wall.

473
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:26,044
This may match
the skull fractures

474
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:27,278
we found on the occipital.

475
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:28,813
Looks like
water evaporated,

476
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:30,748
- leaving rock salt.
- Excuse me, sir.

477
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,283
Yeah?
I'm wondering how long

478
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:34,118
you're gonna be tying up
our parking garage?

479
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:35,553
As long as it takes, I'm afraid.

480
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,488
Some of our members had
to park in the street,

481
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,223
and my car is
blocked in over there.

482
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,926
Yeah, murder's such
an inconvenience, right?

483
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,268
<i>The hard drive</i>

484
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:53,237
from the surveillance camera
is totally fried.

485
00:18:53,272 --> 00:18:54,872
Our killer was pretty thorough.

486
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:57,842
I did manage to get the time
that it was fried though.

487
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:01,245
2:30 a.m. on the night
that Magnuson was murdered.

488
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,014
That syncs up
with Jarrick Henry's story.

489
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:06,717
He said the body was dumped
at his place at 3:30 a.m.

490
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:08,853
I'll tell Booth.

491
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:13,925
I... called...
<i>Science Monthly.</i>

492
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,794
Oh. You didn't
turn them down, did you?

493
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:19,097
Not exactly.
But I did tell them

494
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:22,500
that if they didn't honor
you and Dr. Brennan as well,

495
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,302
that I couldn't
accept the award.

496
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:27,338
You... you told
them to honor <i>me?</i>

497
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:32,477
Oh, my gosh,
you're so sweet.

498
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,045
Hey, we're nothing
without each other, Angela--

499
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,180
that's a fact.
You're amazing.

500
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:38,382
Wait till
I tell Brennan.

501
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:42,286
I'd like to tell her myself--
if this all works out.

502
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:02,940
Mate.

503
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:04,308
Bravo.

504
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:06,844
You have not lost
your edge, Mr. Sweets.

505
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,046
Thank you, Dimitri.
It's my pleasure.

506
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:13,551
Bishop's pair checkmate--
that is so cool.

507
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:15,820
Yeah, I saw
Kasparov do that.

508
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:18,523
Study the greats--
that's what Magnuson taught me.

509
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:20,258
Well played.

510
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,259
Well played.

511
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:22,527
He's a master.

512
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,128
Uh, this is An Ni.

513
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:25,997
It's nice to
meet you, Annie.

514
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:27,932
Not Annie. An Ni.

515
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:30,501
An, first name; Ni, last.

516
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:31,769
You guys'll
have to excuse me.

517
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,638
I have a game starting.

518
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,406
Is that you up
there, Annie--

519
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
uh, An... An...

520
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:37,508
Ni.
Ni.

521
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:38,609
Yes.

522
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:41,679
I had a good year.

523
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:43,314
They let me hold the plaque.

524
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:44,916
When was the
picture taken?

525
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,784
A month or so ago,

526
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:49,687
I think-- I'm not very good with time.
Oh.

527
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,088
What happened
to Magnuson's hand there?

528
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:52,557
Olin.

529
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:56,060
Tiffin Olin.
He broke it with a clock timer.

530
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:58,062
Is Olin in the photo?

531
00:20:58,096 --> 00:21:00,598
No. He got kicked out
of the club for that.

532
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:01,966
Mm.

533
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:05,203
That's him.

534
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,839
When did you last see Olin?

535
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:10,508
You ask so many questions,
curious guy.

536
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,477
Weeks ago.

537
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:15,947
Olin plays in the park now.

538
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:39,370
Tiffin Olin.

539
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:40,805
FBI. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

540
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,540
Need to ask you
a few questions

541
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:43,841
about Albert Magnuson.
I'm playing.

542
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,076
When I finish these games.

543
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,944
Take a break.

544
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:49,413
Albert Magnuson was murdered.

545
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:51,449
We know you broke
his hand in the past.

546
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:52,683
Why'd you break his hand?

547
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,352
Oh, God.

548
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,254
Oh, no.
Whoa, easy, easy!

549
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:57,989
Hold it right there.

550
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,123
Nice and slow.

551
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:01,993
Don't do
anything stupid.

552
00:22:02,027 --> 00:22:05,463
On the table.

553
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:06,931
Easy.

554
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:08,165
What is that?

555
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,533
A sandwich?

556
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:10,968
When I get stressed, I eat.

557
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:12,069
You're accusing me
of killing Albert,

558
00:22:12,104 --> 00:22:14,071
so I'm stressed, I want to eat.

559
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:16,307
Okay, listen, you can
eat after we talk.

560
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:17,975
Magnuson was crazy.

561
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,145
He told everybody that my
cell phone gave off vibrations

562
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,382
in Morse code a-and
that's how I was winning.

563
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,583
Well, was it?

564
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:27,318
Are <i>you</i> crazy?

565
00:22:27,352 --> 00:22:30,354
He just wanted me
out of the tournament

566
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:32,223
because I was his only
serious competition.

567
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:34,158
Where were you three nights ago?

568
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,894
It's embarrassing.

569
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:39,530
More embarrassing than
sitting in an FBI holding cell?

570
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,667
I'm lonely.

571
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:43,734
Okay.

572
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,336
I got arrested
for propositioning

573
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,339
a prostitute
who turned out to be a cop.

574
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:50,074
I spent the night in jail.

575
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:51,375
I-I'm sure you can
verify that.

576
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,877
Booth.

577
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:55,246
I found Magnuson's
ex-wife Ingrid

578
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,747
through her church.

579
00:22:56,782 --> 00:22:59,450
She's in McLean, Virginia,

580
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:01,585
working as a nanny
for a church family

581
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,421
under her maiden name...

582
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:06,057
Ingrid Vanderlube.

583
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:08,025
C-Can I have my sandwich now?

584
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,560
Yeah, you can have
your sandwich.

585
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:11,529
Okay, I'll go bring her in.

586
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,725
<i>I thought my life</i>
<i>with Albert was good.</i>

587
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,862
But getting those
pictures in the mail...

588
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,663
was a real <i>wekroep.</i>

589
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:27,865
I'm sor... A real what?

590
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,266
Wake-up call.

591
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,734
It's Dutch.

592
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:34,404
Right.

593
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,540
Wow... whoa.

594
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:41,111
What was going on in those
photos was unnatural.

595
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:42,412
Evil.

596
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:44,414
And this is Albert and...

597
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:45,983
The hellhag.

598
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,451
Suzanne Levitt.

599
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:49,586
She sent them.

600
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:51,388
The hellhag.

601
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:53,023
Right, you saw
these photos, and, uh,

602
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:56,193
you got upset and you...
burned down his place.

603
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,762
Albert betrayed me.

604
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:01,765
He became an unholy apostate.

605
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,433
A phallacist.

606
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:05,802
Right, that sounds dirty.

607
00:24:05,837 --> 00:24:08,805
His apartment needed
to be cleansed by fire.

608
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,907
Right.

609
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:11,375
So you got off the grid.

610
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,210
Yes.

611
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,379
Earthly laws shouldn't apply
in that situation.

612
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,714
All right, well,
you live on Earth, Ingrid,

613
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,783
and those laws
do apply to you, so...

614
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:21,184
Where were you
three nights ago?

615
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,786
At the house where I work.

616
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,122
The family was out,
but I was there.

617
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:27,391
Okay.

618
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,826
Please, d-don't tell
them about this.

619
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,695
I need that job.

620
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:34,131
Well, I wouldn't
get your hopes up.

621
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:37,634
I mean, um, your visa's expired
and you burn down apartments.

622
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,144
DNA confirmed
that the burned flesh

623
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:49,713
found in the pig slop
<i>was</i> from the victim.

624
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:52,482
And take a look at this.

625
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,821
There are microblisters in the
stratified squamous epithelium

626
00:24:57,855 --> 00:25:00,357
and the external
horny layer.

627
00:25:00,391 --> 00:25:03,126
And enlarged vacuoles
within the epidermal cells.

628
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:05,028
The cells are flattened.

629
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:07,164
What part of the body
was this tissue taken from?

630
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:08,465
The feet.

631
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:12,302
Ah. Now, see,

632
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:14,004
these phalanges may show signs

633
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:15,639
of avulsion fractures
due to subluxation.

634
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:18,508
You're right, but
it's not subluxation.

635
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:20,978
There's a complete
separation there.

636
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:24,314
I think I know what happened!

637
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,016
This is wonderful to see.

638
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,718
Note the capsular ligaments

639
00:25:27,752 --> 00:25:30,654
and coracoacromial ligaments
show signs of stretching

640
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:32,222
and abnormal position.

641
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:35,559
If you add these findings
to the stress fractures

642
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:37,633
and numerous avulsion fractures...
We will find that

643
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:41,632
the answer to how our victim
was killed came from the feet.

644
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,968
The feet.

645
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,705
My, my, my.

646
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,542
I'm surprised to see such
a patriotic Canadian gloating,

647
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:54,144
Dr. Filmore.

648
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,646
You're absolutely right.

649
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,447
I'm sorry.

650
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:03,186
A negative note about a
Canadian, Dr. Filmore?

651
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,788
Oh, yes.

652
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:06,723
A report without negative
comments about a Canadian

653
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:09,760
would be unacceptable in Canada.

654
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:16,633
Excuse me.

655
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:18,735
What's going
on in here?

656
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,038
Well, let's see

657
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,306
as you want us all to think
you are, Sweets.

658
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:24,441
There were actually
people who...

659
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:25,976
I have seniority.

660
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,711
You take white.

661
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:29,546
I won't need the advantage.

662
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,214

00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:28,064
You know my game play.

699
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:29,800
I've been watching you.

700
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,335
And I looked up your old games
on the federation database,

701
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,905
just like Albert taught me.

702
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:45,048
Hey, Hodgins found
clamp marks

703
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:48,151
in the 480-volt main
in the parking garage

704
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,920
where the killer
tied into the panel

705
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:51,254
and created his own circuit.

706
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:52,856
Because of Dr. Filmore,

707
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,792
we know the killer planned
to electrocute Magnuson

708
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,227
as he got into his car.

709
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,595
No accolades, please;
they embarrass me.

710
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:00,430
That was merely
a statement of fact.

711
00:29:00,464 --> 00:29:02,899
Hmm. So, uh, how did the killer

712
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:05,302
connect the circuit
to the victim?

713
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:06,903
According to Hodgins,
the killer

714
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,773
poured water and rock salt
onto the garage floor.

715
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,375
Creating an extremely conductive
electrical environment.

716
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,710
Uh, this should be

717
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:17,047
an accurate reconstruction
of the murder.

718
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:18,615
As Magnuson
returned to his car,

719
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:22,185
the killer placed
the live end

720
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,089
of the circuit into the water
and fried him.

721
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:29,059
And the shock was so traumatic,
it literally blew

722
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:30,961
the victim's toes off.
And created stress

723
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:33,230
and avulsion fractures
throughout the body.

724
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:35,065
And launched him into the wall

725
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:37,400
where we found
the bloodstains.

726
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:41,037
Breaking bones of his left hand
when it hit first.

727
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:44,341
The surge of power fried the
surveillance camera hard drive.

728
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,276
And blew out
the jelly jar lights.

729
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,712
The only problem is
that none of our suspects

730
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,614
could have been there
when this happened.

731
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:53,149
Except the woman
he was going to marry.

732
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:04,594
Well, you-you had me there.

733
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:06,863
Why didn't you
sacrifice your queen?

734
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:09,633
I didn't see it.

735
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,402
I don't believe that
for a second.

736
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,204
What's he doing?

737
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:16,506
Make your move.

738
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:31,588
You want to take a nap?

739
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,057
No, I'm fine.

740
00:31:08,192 --> 00:31:10,493
You're playing
way above your rating.

741
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:12,329
Magnuson wasn't your mentor.

742
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:16,032
He thought he was.

743
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:21,638
All right.

744
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,908
All right.

745
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:32,582
Checkmate.

746
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,386
Wow, nice.

747
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,988
He did it.

748
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,190
Tim Levitt, you're under arrest
for the murder

749
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:41,858
of Albert Magnuson.

750
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:47,512
<i>You arrested this kid</i>

751
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:49,113
'cause he beat you at chess?

752
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:50,548
Listen, he could've won
much earlier in the game,

753
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,317
but he refused
to sacrifice his queen.

754
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:54,919
His queen? Okay, do you know
how crazy you sound right now?

755
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,955
It's symbolic of Tim not wanting
to sacrifice his mother.

756
00:31:56,989 --> 00:31:58,089
The two of them are too close.

757
00:31:58,123 --> 00:31:59,324
Plus, he didn't yawn when I did.

758
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:01,025
That's not gonna hold up
in court.

759
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,894
It's a test for sociopaths.
A normal person,

760
00:32:02,928 --> 00:32:04,762
when they see someone yawn,
they yawn.

761
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,998
Sociopaths don't
'cause they don't have empathy.

762
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:09,334
The kid has an alibi. He was
at a deli, but his mother...

763
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:10,602
The mother was going
to marry Magnuson.

764
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,370
To Tim, he was being replaced.

765
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:13,538
He's guilty, Booth.

766
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:15,240
He's guilty; I know it.

767
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:21,980
Fine. Let me go
talk to him.

768
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:24,015
No, no, no, let me.
No.

769
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,283
We got him for six hours
before we have

770
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:26,217
to release him; let me at him.

771
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:27,318
No. You're a shrink;

772
00:32:27,353 --> 00:32:28,353
I'm a trained interrogator.

773
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:29,554
But this isn't

774
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,289
a normal interrogation, is it?

775
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:32,423
To Tim, this is chess.

776
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:33,725
And every move he's made so far

777
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,493
has been a brilliant

778
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:37,695
and careful calculation.

779
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:41,866
Okay, one shot.
That's it.

780
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,735
If I see you going south
with this,

781
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,937
or you're screwing it up, I'm
gonna pull you from the room.

782
00:32:45,971 --> 00:32:47,705
Great.

783
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:51,242
It's been two hours.

784
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:52,644
Why are you keeping me here?

785
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:54,279
I haven't done anything wrong.

786
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:55,680
Sit down, Tim.

787
00:32:55,714 --> 00:32:58,249
Let me tell you
what we know so far.

788
00:32:58,284 --> 00:33:01,119
Is that the killer?
He's so young.

789
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:02,687
Yeah, and very smart.

790
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:04,489
You dumped the body
at Jarrick's house

791
00:33:04,523 --> 00:33:06,558
because you knew he'd
get rid of it for you.

792
00:33:06,592 --> 00:33:09,360
You introduced me to An Ni
'cause you knew

793
00:33:09,395 --> 00:33:10,862
she'd lead us to Tiffin Olin.

794
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:13,064
You've been playing us all

795
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:14,766
from the beginning,
like we're your chess pieces.

796
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,069
Dr. Sweets,
I didn't do anything like this.

797
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:20,104
- Let me tell you what I think.
<i>- See, that's good.</i>

798
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:21,606
He's staying in control,

799
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,041
not letting him say
that he's innocent.

800
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:24,542
Take his coat off;
it says that,

801
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,144
you know what, he
ain't going anywhere.

802
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:27,979
Dr. Sweets,

803
00:33:28,013 --> 00:33:29,814
I loved Albert.
I would never do any...

804
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:31,316
You didn't love Albert.

805
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,850
Nobody did.

806
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,086
Even your mom said
that he was volatile

807
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,754
and had a temper.

808
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,289
People would say

809
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:40,658
that you did the world a
favor by taking him out.

810
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:42,760
What Sweets is saying is absurd.

811
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,028
It's called developing themes.

812
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,263
He's giving him
alternative versions

813
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:47,131
of the crime
so he might admit to it.

814
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,333
But it's not working.

815
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,767
Well, of course it's not.

816
00:33:49,802 --> 00:33:51,603
I mean, if he was guilty,
he'd be leaning back.

817
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:53,004
Oh, right.

818
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:54,639
Because kinesiology suggests
that he'd maintain

819
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:56,808
as much distance
from his accuser as possible.

820
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:58,076
Fascinating.

821
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,911
<i>So, I managed</i>

822
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:01,346
to retrieve a
partial image

823
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,781
from the surveillance
camera hard drive.

824
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:05,116
Now, this is the moment

825
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,151
when Magnuson
was electrocuted.

826
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:09,120
Take a look at this.

827
00:34:09,154 --> 00:34:12,423
On the left is Magnuson,
and on the right is the killer.

828
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,525
But look at the time stamp.

829
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,329
He was killed two hours
earlier than we thought.

830
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:20,398
Wait. But your analysis
of the hard drive showed

831
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:22,266
it was fried at 2:30 a.m.

832
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:24,035
Because there were
two power surges.

833
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:27,438
There was one at 12:30,
which killed Magnuson,

834
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:30,508
and another at 2:30 which fried
the surveillance hard drive.

835
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,210
How did he cause
the second power surge

836
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:34,145
when he was at the deli?
My guess:

837
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,447
he isolated the circuit
for the surveillance camera,

838
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:37,982
put it on a timer,

839
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:39,684
and came back later
and removed the evidence.

840
00:34:39,718 --> 00:34:41,452
Tim has no alibi.

841
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:42,887
Unfortunately,
this is not enough evidence

842
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:44,322
for a conviction.

843
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:45,857
We need a confession.

844
00:34:52,197 --> 00:34:55,133
I'd like some more water,
please.

845
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,168
You've had
enough water, Tim.

846
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:59,337
Setting that trap
to electrocute Albert--

847
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:02,106
now, that required
a lot of expertise.

848
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,941
You could have
killed yourself.

849
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,476
Lucky for you,

850
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,345
you took that electrical
engineering course in school.

851
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:10,314
Mr. Wakefield worked
as an electrician for years.

852
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,817
Maybe you should talk to him.

853
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,552
<i>He's countering</i>

854
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:15,953
every move Sweets makes.

855
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,689
This <i>is</i> like chess.

856
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:19,190
He's playing this perfectly.

857
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:21,225
Your mom had a couple of
boyfriends before Albert,

858
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,327
and those ended
badly, too, huh?

859
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:25,897
Too? My mom
and Albert were happy.

860
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:29,867
His temper, the fighting,
his wanting you to move out.

861
00:35:29,902 --> 00:35:31,235
He didn't want that.

862
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,937
We were close, all of us.

863
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:34,539
That's not
what your mother said.

864
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,311
You're really reaching,
Dr. Sweets.

865
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:41,879
And you're leaning back, Tim.

866
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:43,414
If I could hit the
timer now, I would.

867
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:45,149
Boom. That was good.

868
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,784
You're the only one
that your mother

869
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,319
could count on, right?

870
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:51,789
You're the only one
that can make her happy.

871
00:35:51,824 --> 00:35:54,192
Albert made her happy.

872
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:55,727
Albert made...? Okay.

873
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:58,329
Well, taking these photos
of Albert and your mom

874
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:01,299
and sending them to his ex-wife
Ingrid-- that sounds like

875
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,900
a happy family, right?

876
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:04,502
I didn't take any photos,
Dr. Sweets.

877
00:36:04,536 --> 00:36:06,404
You would do anything
to protect your mom.

878
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:08,239
That's why you refused
to sacrifice your queen.

879
00:36:08,273 --> 00:36:10,074
That's why you killed Albert,
isn't it?

880
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:12,143
Sweets' logic
is quite manipulative

881
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:14,779
and very impressive.

882
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:17,582
You're inventing a motive based
off of a chess game we played?

883
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:19,517
Really, Dr. Sweets?

884
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:21,886
I thought
you were smarter than that.

885
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,988
Game play mirrors
the personality of the player.

886
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:26,057
Didn't Albert teach you that?

887
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:28,126
All I can say is the same thing
I've been saying

888
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,527
for the last three hours.

889
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:31,529
I did not kill Albert Magnuson.

890
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:33,931
Well, I'd advise you to
call your lawyer, Tim.

891
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:36,934
Why? I haven't done
anything wrong.

892
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,138
I really would like
that water now,

893
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:41,572
please, if that's all right.

894
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,811
I just need one more shot
with him.

895
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:49,113
Trust me, Sweets,
this is gonna work, okay?

896
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:51,516
Booth is right. It's
like the queen sacrifice

897
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,934
Marshall used against
Levitsky in 1912.

898
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:54,986
What?

899
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:56,854
He wouldn't see that coming.
How'd you know about that?

900
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,589
I play, too.
Not like you, of course.

901
00:36:58,624 --> 00:36:59,957
I've been trying

902
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:01,659
to teach Booth, but
he keeps referring

903
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:03,427
to the knights as "horsies."

904
00:37:03,462 --> 00:37:04,896
That's great.
Can we just move this along?

905
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,297
Okay, chess is
a one-on-one game,

906
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,499
but in a real war,
you need a platoon,

907
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:10,168
and that's what
we are right now, okay?

908
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,702
So let's move out.

909
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:19,677
I'd like to apologize, Tim.

910
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:21,212
You're free to go.

911
00:37:21,246 --> 00:37:22,547
We found the killer.

912
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:24,682
What?

913
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:28,286
I was mistaken,
and I'd like to offer my help,

914
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,955
because this could be
very difficult for you.

915
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:33,257
I don't understand.

916
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,860
Your mother had access to your
electrical engineering books.

917
00:37:35,894 --> 00:37:37,595
That doesn't mean anything.

918
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,497
There's more, Tim.

919
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:42,266
We have a partial DNA match from
the trunk of the victim's car.

920
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,901
It's either yours or your mom's.

921
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:45,703
You have an alibi,
and she doesn't.

922
00:37:45,737 --> 00:37:47,705
My mom wouldn't do that.

923
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:48,873
This is clearly painful for you.

924
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:50,141
I-I misunderstood

925
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:52,109
your relationship
with your mother.

926
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,278
She was the one who'd do
anything to protect you.

927
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,781
She felt that Albert
was taking you away from her.

928
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:58,482
No, you've got it all wrong.

929
00:37:58,517 --> 00:37:59,584
No, Tim.

930
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,385
She confessed.

931
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,855
Confessed?

932
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:07,892
Tim! Timmy!

933
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:09,327
Mom.
Tim, call a lawyer.

934
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,429
Hold him
back, Sweets.

935
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:12,997
Timmy...
Hold him back! Hold him back!

936
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,265
Call me a lawyer!

937
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:15,433
You-you can't do this.

938
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,401
It wasn't her!
I did it!

939
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:20,605
I set a timer.
That's how I got my alibi.

940
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,240
It wasn't her!

941
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:24,275
I killed Albert!

942
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:25,676
You did what?

943
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,445
I did it!
That-that was my DNA!

944
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,814
I... I'll-I'll tell you
everything!

945
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:31,782
Just don't take my mom.
No.

946
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:33,517
I had to.

947
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:38,089
I had to protect you.

948
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:40,424
I couldn't let another guy
take you away!

949
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:42,960
Tim, what have you done?

950
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:46,664
What have you done?

951
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:48,032
You were right.

952
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:50,134
He couldn't sacrifice
his own queen.

953
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:03,814
Dr. Brennan,
I just thought

954
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:05,583
I'd drop by your office
before I leave.

955
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:08,119
You've finished cleaning
the bone room already?

956
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:09,954
Well, actually, I won't be
cleaning the bone room,

957
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:11,822
Dr. Brennan,
and I thank you for that.

958
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:14,025
That makes no sense.

959
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:16,827
I'm asserting myself--
something I learned from you,

960
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,796
which I intend to share
with all my Canadian colleagues.

961
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,266
I've decided, like you,
I'm too extraordinary to clean.

962
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:24,435
But...
You've been

963
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:26,270
an excellent example
to me, Dr. Brennan.

964
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:28,139
Be confident, be stubborn,

965
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:30,007
and shout down
the opposition, eh?

966
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:31,609
Well, I...
I must go now.

967
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:34,845
And you're welcome
for my outstanding expertise.

968
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,981
Oh, you're
also welcome.

969
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:41,719
What's this?

970
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:44,155
This is from <i>Science Monthly.</i>

971
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:49,193
Oh, Cam,
I'm actually very happy for you.

972
00:39:49,227 --> 00:39:51,028
Apologies are difficult for me.

973
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:53,698
No. I appreciate that,
Dr. Brennan,

974
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:56,534
but they actually want
to honor all three of us.

975
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,169
Oh. Really?

976
00:39:58,203 --> 00:39:59,804
Because Cam insisted.

977
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:01,238
We're nothing
without each other.

978
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,274
Well, agreed,
but I've never heard

979
00:40:03,308 --> 00:40:05,876
of them honoring
three women before.

980
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:09,513
Well, uh, this year,
there are 12.

981
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:11,382
Twelve?

982
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:16,454
They, uh... they sent us these
for a photo shoot.

983
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:20,691
They're doing a calendar
this year.

984
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:24,795
12 Outstanding Women of Science
showing a lot of skin.

985
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,063
Magazine's having
budget problems,

986
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:27,531
and they thought
this would help.

987
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:29,567
I can tell them
to call three other scientists.

988
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,702
Who are the nine scientists
who agreed to this?

989
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:32,870
Um...

990
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:36,607
Oh. Dr. Katherine Kasarinsky...

991
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:40,211
Oh, she's a brilliant
quantum physicist.

992
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:41,479
Dr. Jennifer Austin.

993
00:40:41,513 --> 00:40:42,580
She won the National
Medal of Science.

994
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:43,948
Yes.

995
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:45,182
Dr. Sun Yoon Chang...

996
00:40:45,217 --> 00:40:47,785
She's a Delta Science Fellow.

997
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:50,521
So they actually are
outstanding women of science.

998
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:53,391
I would hate to think of

999
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:56,961
three <i>less</i> outstanding women
replacing us.

1000
00:40:56,995 --> 00:40:58,996
But we'll be hanging in labs
all across the country.

1001
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:00,431
Exactly.

1002
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:03,701
We have a duty to show
the scientific community

1003
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:05,002
that the Jeffersonian

1004
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:06,504
is an institution
where pulchritude

1005
00:41:06,538 --> 00:41:09,640
is as abundant
as brilliance.

1006
00:41:09,674 --> 00:41:11,475
I never thought

1007
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,411
that I would be
honored in this way.

1008
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,514
Okay.

1009
00:41:16,548 --> 00:41:18,849
Oh, my God.

1010
00:41:18,884 --> 00:41:21,285
Dr. McClintock looks
wonderful on your breasts.

1011
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:22,486
Lookin' good.

1012
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,055
Oh, my God.

1013
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:25,556
I'm glad I got
Madame Curie.

1014
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,124
I can't...

1015
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:39,970
Ah!

1016
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:41,272
No...

1017
00:41:41,306 --> 00:41:43,507
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What?

1018
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,976
You can't make that move.
Why?

1019
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:48,145
Bishops can only move diagonally.
I thought that was the castle.

1020
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,681
That's a rook. It's called a rook.
Chess is like school.

1021
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:52,483
Why can't we just play checkers?

1022
00:41:52,517 --> 00:41:55,252
No, there's no sophisticated
strategy in checkers.

1023
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:56,420
How about we have a game

1024
00:41:56,455 --> 00:41:58,956
of Ready, Set, Fun?

1025
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,158
What? Christine's game?
Yeah.

1026
00:42:01,193 --> 00:42:03,060
No, it's for children.

1027
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:04,829
What, you think I'm gonna kick
your ass in the Happy Hideaway?

1028
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:06,297
No, we're playing
chess, Booth.

1029
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:07,631
Right.
It's my move.

1030
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:08,799
Here we go!

1031
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,367
I'm not doing this, Booth.

1032
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,802
Come on.

1033
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:13,671
I'll be Tom Foolery...

1034
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:14,939
...and you can be

1035
00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:16,640
Wendy Whoopee!

1036
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:18,109
No, no, no.

1037
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:20,344
I'm always
Hildy Highjinks.

1038
00:42:20,378 --> 00:42:22,379
Hildy Highjinks, right.
You're getting into it, right?

1039
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,681
Okay, tell you what:

1040
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:26,083
if you pick a card
that says Two Giggles,

1041
00:42:26,118 --> 00:42:27,184
you got to do a shot.

1042
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:28,385
One game.

1043
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,653
That's all it's gonna take.

1044
00:42:29,688 --> 00:42:32,089
Ready, set, pick.

1045
00:42:32,124 --> 00:42:33,524
Okay.

1046
00:42:33,558 --> 00:42:35,326
I think I should come
to the photo shoot with you.

1047
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,560
Ooh...
I really do.

1048
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,329
Not going to happen.

1049
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:39,930
Right.

1050
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:42,366
Dah! Two Giggles! Drink!

1051
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,734
No, it's your card.
You drink.

1052
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:46,470
Hey... we both drink.

1053
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:47,705
Okay?

1054
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:49,340
There it is.

1055
00:42:49,374 --> 00:42:50,541
Down the hatch.

1056
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:52,409
Mmm. You know what?

1057
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:53,577
I want to come
to the photo shoot with you.

1058
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,578
You know, for science.

1059
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,080
No.

1060
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:58,616
Look who's going to
Happy Hideaway.

1061
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,417
Who's giggling now?
Isn't this a lot better than chess?

1062
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:05,452
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

1063
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,793
What's that mean?

1063
00:43:10,305 --> 00:43:16,209
