Get back here!

00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:27,041
Get 'em!

Watch out!

23
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:48,604
All right. We're here.

24
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:51,735
I told you, ain't no room!

25
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,778
Just the boy then.

26
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,158
Hey! Hey! Goddammit, O. B.!

27
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,118
It's gonna be okay, baby. All right?

28
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,842
You're gonna go with Heck and Liddy,

29
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,887
and they're gonna get
you someplace safe.

30
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,290
Are you comin' too?

31
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:10,920
We're gonna be right
behind you, all right?

32
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,927
Get her!

33
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:24,642
We gotta go now!

34
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:26,936
Don't move.

35
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:33,026
Hey, get your thumb out your mouth, boy.

36
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:36,153
O.B., come on! We gotta go!

37
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:38,490
- Be strong.
- Okay.

38
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,533
Get down.

Shit, shit.

00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,620
This interaction
is being recorded.

45
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,081
Do you consent?

46
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,335
Yes, sir. Sure.

47
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:50,714
It is... 9:35 p. M., September 8, 2019.

48
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:52,258
Initiated traffic stop.

49
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,803
How are you tonight, sir?

50
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:57,512
Good. Yeah, fine. Thanks.

51
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,309
- How are you?
- What you drinking there?

52
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,728
Oh, uh...

53
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:04,856
Coca-Cola, sir.

54
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:06,730
Mm.

55
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:08,317
What are you hauling?

56
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,154
Lettuce.

57
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,405
Lettuce?

58
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,909
- Yes, sir.
- Can I take a look?

59
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,996
Can I take a look at
your face?

60
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,583
What did you just say to me?

61
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:27,126
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry, officer.

62
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:30,715
- I was just kidding.
- License and registration.

63
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:37,136
They're in the glove.

64
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:40,057
I'm just gonna reach over
and open it on up, okay?

65
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:43,102
Go ahead.

66
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,992
Three-five, returned to vehicle.

67
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,997
I need Weapons Autho. Who's on the desk?

68
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,707
<i>Panda. I'll patch you through.</i>

69
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,168
Shit. No, wait. Is there anyone else...

70
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,088
<i>This is Panda. What's up?</i>

71
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,557
Hey, I just made a traffic stop.

72
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,267
Subject refused a search of his truck,

73
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,397
and I observed Kavalry
contraband in his glove.

74
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,816
Requesting firearm lock release.

75
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,987
<i>What kind of contraband?</i>

76
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:38,280
It was a Rorschach mask.

77
00:10:38,282 --> 00:10:39,740
<i>Are you sure?</i>

78
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:42,701
I saw it. Panda, come on.

79
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:43,856
Release my weapon.

80
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:46,455
<i>Probability of drugs and/or alcohol</i>

81
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:48,791
- <i>in the subject's vehicle?</i>
- High.

82
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:51,502
<i>Probability of firearms and/or explosives</i>

83
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:54,582
- <i>in the vehicle?</i>
- High.

84
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,841
<i>What's your overall perceived
threat level from the subject?</i>

85
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:01,845
High. Just... buzz me, okay?

86
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,140
<i>Stand by.</i>

87
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:09,311
It's not working, I didn't get it.

88
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:10,421
Buzz me again, man.

89
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:11,842
<i>Stand by.</i>

90
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,323
<i>We good?</i>

91
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,991
Yeah, I got it. Thank you.

92
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:33,247
They bring my uniform up?

93
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:34,959
Next room over.

94
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:52,601
- Mind if I have a minute?
- Of course, sir.

95
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,816
You running background
checks on all the nurses

96
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:02,776
and orderlies that saw his face?

97
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:03,863
Yep.

98
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:16,165
We got roadblocks up
on all the egresses,

99
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,419
but he's probably gone to ground.

100
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,129
Sent a couple units out
to the address on his DL,

101
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:24,341
but the house was boarded up.

102
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,848
- Kavalry?
- More than likely.

103
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:34,683
You want me to call in Red and Night?

104
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:36,061
No.

105
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:39,980
Let 'em sleep.

106
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,149
She gonna be pissed.

107
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:46,361
Why in Christ's name would
they start this shit up again?

108
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,155
Maybe there was somethin' in the truck

109
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:50,115
they didn't want found.

110
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:51,450
Somethin' like what?

111
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:54,244
There was a head of
lettuce in Sutton's car.

112
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:56,496
Shooter must've tossed it in.

113
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:58,584
I believe it was romaine.

114
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,338
Were there any croutons?

115
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,841
Not that I could ascertain.

116
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:11,595
You don't start a war
over goddamn lettuce, Wade.

117
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:14,016
Come over here and pull your face down.

118
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,108
Mrs. Sutton?

119
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:06,819
Roberta.

120
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:10,614
Roberta, I'm Judd.

121
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,242
May I come in?

122
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:16,412
Yeah.

123
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:21,247
There was a shooting.

124
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,002
Charlie's in surgery now.

125
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,210
When he's out, we're gonna move him

126
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:28,630
to our secure medical
facility over at the precinct.

127
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:31,093
Ah. Okay.

128
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:34,052
Can I go see him?

129
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,639
Of course.

130
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:43,814
Did he tell anyone that he was police?

131
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,940
That's against the rules.

132
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,277
Yeah.

133
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:51,488
But people still talk.

134
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,493
He didn't.

135
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:03,081
Where did he tell folks that he
was going when he was on shift?

136
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,545
Night school, for engineering.

137
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:08,797
All right.

138
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:12,132
We'll say it was a carjacking.

139
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:15,177
He was leaving school and
that's when he got shot.

140
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,678
Why?

141
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,972
We have protocols.

142
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:21,558
We just want to keep everybody safe.

143
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,727
Safe.

144
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,480
- Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'.
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:29,151
Fuck me and the horse I rode in on.

146
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,572
He liked you.

147
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:37,493
No. He likes me.

148
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,338
<i>Egg whites are made of protein.</i>

149
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,799
<i>When we whip 'em, we get bubbles,</i>

150
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:57,302
<i>and it's the proteins that form
the walls of those bubbles.</i>

151
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:01,899
<i>If we don't have walls, it
all comes tumblin' down.</i>

152
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,108
Now, those walls are strong,
but they won't stay that way

153
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,069
if just even a little bit of yolk

154
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:16,571
gets mixed in with the whites.

155
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:20,911
So, that's why we gotta separate 'em.

156
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:27,582
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

157
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,585
Can we eat our cookies now, please?

158
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:32,131
Y'all go ahead.

159
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:37,801
Okay, Ms. Abar, while
they're stuffing their faces,

160
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,472
maybe you can explain to
them what they're eating.

161
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,933
Oh, um...

162
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,351
It's called a banh bia.

163
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,646
When I was a little girl in Vietnam,

164
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:51,732
we called them "mooncakes."

165
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:55,986
Oh, were you born there before
or after it became a state?

166
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:59,283
Um, a couple years before.

167
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:05,411
Um, I was born just outside of Saigon

168
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:08,457
and when I grew up, I
was a police officer there

169
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,718
until I moved here to Tulsa.

170
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:12,252
Did you stay a police officer?

171
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:15,297
For a while, then I retired.

172
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,633
Why?

173
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,762
Um...

174
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,809
I was one of the cops who got
attacked on the White Night.

175
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:31,146
And that was before police
officers were allowed to wear masks.

176
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:33,982
So, the bad guys, they knew who I was

177
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,984
and they knew where I lived,

178
00:19:35,986 --> 00:19:38,820
and they came to my
house and they shot me.

179
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:40,155
Right here.

180
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:42,866
And the doctors, they had
to pull apart my insides

181
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,285
to find the bullet and get it out

182
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,829
- 'cause they didn't want it to...
- Ahem.

183
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:52,042
Oh, um, anyway.

184
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:54,336
I figured making cakes and cookies

185
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:56,507
was better than getting shot.

186
00:19:57,257 --> 00:20:02,179
So, I quit the police force
and opened up a bakery.

187
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,805
Mm-hmm?

188
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:07,017
Did Redfordations pay for it?

189
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,187
Excuse me?

190
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,773
Your bakery... did you
pay for it with Redfordations?

191
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:15,899
Tommy!

192
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:19,093
Ooh! Topher!

193
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:30,541
Don't tilt your head
back, just pinch your nose.

194
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,045
Why'd you hit him?

195
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:38,380
'Cause you wanted to hit him.

196
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:40,425
He's ten years old.

197
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,178
You still wanted to.

198
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:47,138
He said... Redfordations.

199
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,767
I heard him.

200
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:54,187
- He's a racist.
- He's not racist.

201
00:20:54,189 --> 00:20:56,400
But he's off to a good start.

202
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:03,365
Oh, goddammit.

203
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:20,799
Maybe it's a false...

204
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,145
It smells.

205
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:18,273
Well, at least your nose is working.

206
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:31,828
- Oh, get the truck.
- Get the truck!

207
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,835
Hey.

208
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,298
- We're cleaning up the squids.
- Thanks, baby!

209
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:47,511
Hey, you left your pager. It's
been going off all morning.

210
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,727
What's Little Big Horn?

211
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,855
I gotta go to the bakery.

212
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:01,356
You pick up Rosie from school?

213
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:02,693
Of course.

214
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:06,695
Sweetie, I need you to go with Dad

215
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:08,822
and pick up your sister
from school, okay?

216
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:10,575
Don't let him drive too fast.

217
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:15,038
- I love you, sweetie.
- Love you too, Mommy.

218
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:17,372
I also love you.

219
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:18,873
Don't drive fast.

220
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,709
No TV!

221
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:22,711
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

222
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,212
The New York Times <i>is calling it</i>

223
00:23:24,214 --> 00:23:27,799
<i>the most important television
event of the new millennium.</i>

224
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:30,552
<i>Tomorrow night, the countdown ends.</i>

225
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:33,805
American Hero Story: Minutemen.

226
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:03,211
- Do you own that place?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,921
- When is gonna open?
- A couple months.

228
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,258
Mm-hmm.

229
00:24:09,301 --> 00:24:10,759
I'll wait.

230
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:11,928
Hey.

231
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:16,099
You think I can lift 200 pounds?

232
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:20,479
Sure you could.

233
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:35,677
Whoa! Hey!

234
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,828
<i>Cop carcass
on the highway last night.</i>

235
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,291
<i>Soon, the accumulated black
filth will be hosed away,</i>

236
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:10,128
<i>and the streets of Tulsa will
turn into extended gutters</i>

237
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,672
<i>overflowing with liberal tears.</i>

238
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:17,844
<i>Soon all the whores and race
traitors will shout "Save us!"</i>

239
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:21,558
<i>And we will whisper... No.</i>

240
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:26,269
<i>We are the Seventh Kavalry.</i>

241
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:31,900
<i>We are no one. We are
everyone. We are invisible.</i>

242
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:34,444
<i>And we will never compromise.</i>

243
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:38,364
<i>Do not stand between us and our mission,</i>

244
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:41,200
<i>or there will be more dead cops.</i>

245
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:44,287
<i>There are so many
deserving of retribution</i>

246
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:46,789
<i>and there is so little time.</i>

247
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:50,545
<i>And that time is near.</i>

248
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:56,925
<i>Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock.</i>

249
00:26:56,927 --> 00:27:02,676
<i>Ticktock.
Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock.</i>

250
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:05,767
<i>Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock.</i>

251
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:09,481
<i>Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock.</i>

252
00:27:09,484 --> 00:27:11,872
<i>Ticktock! Ticktock! Ticktock!</i>

253
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:15,161
<i>Ticktock! Ticktock! Ticktock! Ticktock!</i>

254
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:18,613
Kavalry's back.

255
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,577
Three years of peace,

256
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:27,499
and we convinced ourselves
that they were gone.

257
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:30,296
But they were just hibernating.

258
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:33,419
Good thing we know
where their caves are.

259
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,465
So roll into Nixonville
and round 'em up,

260
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:40,551
and drag their asses into
the pod for interrogation.

261
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:42,395
One of them's gonna give up the shooter.

262
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:44,472
Warrants-free, weapons hot?

263
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:47,460
We are Article Four.

264
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:49,646
Panda, buzz out the guns.

265
00:27:53,316 --> 00:27:57,402
"An emergency 24-hour
release of deadly weapons

266
00:27:57,404 --> 00:27:59,653
- can be authorized only...
- Shut the fuck up, Panda.

267
00:27:59,656 --> 00:28:02,156
...if the majority of the police force

268
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:06,119
believe their lives are under
direct immediate threat."

269
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:07,664
LG...

270
00:28:08,748 --> 00:28:12,333
do you believe your life is
under direct and immediate threat?

271
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:13,751
Yes, I do.

272
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:15,797
What about you, Red?

273
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:18,214
Absolutely.

274
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:24,387
Firearms release is authorized.

275
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:28,489
Chief, you're making a mistake.

276
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,020
Yeah, well...

277
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,897
it's my funeral.

278
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:36,693
<i>Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</i>

279
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:39,696
<i>Nos costodimus!</i>

280
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,878
Why didn't you call me?

281
00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:00,506
Wanna take your feet
off my desk, please?

282
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:03,551
Kavalry involved shooting last night,

283
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:06,637
and I don't get a Little
Big Horn until two hours ago?

284
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:08,598
We were still working
the scene. It was late.

285
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,561
Mm. I know why you didn't call me.

286
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:14,397
Why?

287
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,565
You were mad that my sitter bailed

288
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,567
and you had to suffer
through black <i>Oklahoma</i>

289
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:21,944
without having someone
to roll your eyes at.

290
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:25,156
- Sitter bailed?
- Yes.

291
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,992
Well, you and Cal missed out,

292
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:31,204
because black <i>Oklahoma</i>
was delightful.

293
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:33,247
You are not allowed to call it that.

294
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,957
You gonna give me the speech now?

295
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,584
What speech?

296
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:40,296
About how I'm overreacting
by calling Article Four,

297
00:29:40,298 --> 00:29:44,467
and I should calm down and take a
breath before we're at war again.

298
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:46,137
There's a guy in my trunk.

299
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:52,892
I knew you were gonna tell
us to round up the likelies.

300
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:55,146
I just got a jump on things.

301
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,567
You knew?

302
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,945
Yes.

303
00:30:03,113 --> 00:30:05,156
How do you know he's Seven K?

304
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:10,578
I got a nose for white supremacy,
and he smells like bleach.

305
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:16,501
So, put him in the pod?

306
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:23,007
Put him in the pod.

307
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:49,159
Howdy.

308
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:52,994
I'm just gonna ask you
a series of questions.

309
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:56,332
Answer them honestly
and you can go home.

310
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,796
Do you know why you're here?

311
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:06,257
Some bitch dressed like a nun

312
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,177
kicked in my door and put me
in the trunk of her fucking car.

313
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,181
That is correct.

314
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:14,223
I want my lawyer.

315
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:18,060
Yeah, we really don't
have to do that with terrorists.

316
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:20,021
I... I'm not a terrorist.

317
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,824
How long have you lived in Tulsa?

318
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:39,540
Uh, five years... six. Almost six.

319
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:42,212
What did you have for
breakfast this morning?

320
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:46,297
Cereal, I think.

321
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:48,633
If I defecated on the American flag,

322
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:50,595
how would that make you feel?

323
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:52,470
Defecated?

324
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:57,058
Shit. If I took a shit
on the American flag,

325
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,729
how would that make you feel?

326
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,565
Confused.

327
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:06,234
Are you a member of or
do you associate with

328
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:08,903
members of the white
supremacist organization

329
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:11,115
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

330
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,035
No.

331
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:17,411
Do you believe that
transdimensional attacks

332
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:21,209
are hoaxes staged by
the U.S. Government?

333
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:23,125
I dunno, maybe.

334
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:25,920
Are you a member of or
do you associate with

335
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:28,756
members of the white
supremacist organization

336
00:32:28,758 --> 00:32:30,841
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

337
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:32,260
You already asked me that.

338
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:35,096
- Should all Americans pay taxes?
- Yes.

339
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:37,431
Are you a member of or
do you associate with

340
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,850
members of the white
supremacist organization

341
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:41,310
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

342
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:43,938
Are you a member of or
do you associate with

343
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,232
members of the white
supremacist organization

344
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:47,441
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

345
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:50,069
Are you a member of or
do you associate with

346
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:52,238
members of the white supremacist group

347
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,739
known as the Seventh Kavalry?

348
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:56,494
No... No.

349
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:25,189
Well?

350
00:33:27,317 --> 00:33:28,941
He knows.

351
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,484
You sure?

352
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,956
He's not gonna talk sans motivation,

353
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,323
but he was off the charts
on the bias questions.

354
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:39,535
Eyes dilated on all the Rorschachs.

355
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,831
Yeah. I'm sure.

356
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:45,960
Like I said...

357
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,671
bleach.

358
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:02,226
<i>Cop got shot, so we're
all a little wound up here.</i>

359
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:07,648
But still that's no excuse
for how I treated you.

360
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:10,234
Sorry.

361
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:13,319
Yeah, okay.

362
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:15,239
Appreciate your understanding.

363
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:20,536
Fuck!

364
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:22,995
Fuck you!

365
00:34:22,997 --> 00:34:26,040
Where... is... he?

366
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:27,750
Where is he?!

367
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:30,004
Where... is... he?!

368
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:36,219
Where is he?!

369
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:40,846
Where is he?!

370
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,890
Where is he?!

371
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,155
Cattle ranch.

372
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:37,486
We're almost at the
house. Is there any movement inside?

373
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:39,824
<i>Do you got a head count?</i>

374
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:43,185
Looks like four.

375
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:44,705
<i>Maybe five.</i>

376
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:03,264
Cops! Pack it up! Let's go!

377
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:05,808
Let's head on out! Come on!

378
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,309
Aw, shit! They're moving!

379
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:10,269
Go. Go now!

380
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:15,824
Take that.

381
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:17,568
All right. Come
on, boys, let's go!

382
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,638
Come on! Come on!

383
00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:43,137
Down! Down! Everybody down!

384
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:28,850
They've
got a fucking plane.

385
00:37:53,931 --> 00:37:55,350
Come on, go!

386
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:14,103
Aah!

387
00:38:58,389 --> 00:38:59,641
Fucker!

388
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:02,524
Spit it out! Spit it out, motherfucker!

389
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:04,068
Spit it out!

390
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:08,616
Fuck!

391
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:23,673
Pill?

392
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:27,981
Fucking coward!

393
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,511
Where are the others?

394
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:32,848
Shit!

395
00:39:35,393 --> 00:39:38,519
Crawford! Crawford! Two of them got out.

396
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:41,563
They're taking off.
They're right under you.

397
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:43,023
All right. Bring her out.

398
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:00,376
Good.

399
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:14,223
Stay with 'em.

400
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:18,561
Higher.

401
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,108
Higher.

402
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,026
- Higher, damn it!
- I'm trying!

403
00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:31,282
Chief, fucking
quit! The ship can't take it!

404
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:51,052
Fuck!

405
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,471
Are you okay?

406
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,351
Oh, shit!

407
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:52,778
What the fuck?

408
00:42:50,212 --> 00:42:53,885
- Welcome home, Master.
- Thank you, Alphonse.

409
00:43:07,855 --> 00:43:10,397
Your thighs are quite raw, Master.

410
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:13,360
Yes, I rode quite a distance yesterday.

411
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:16,195
But don't worry, Ms. Crookshanks.

412
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,281
Have at it.

413
00:43:22,578 --> 00:43:24,121
Sir.

414
00:43:25,163 --> 00:43:26,412
Shall I dress you?

415
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:29,374
Looks a little formal, Mr. Philips.

416
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:33,088
- Is it a special occasion?
- Of course it is, Master.

417
00:43:35,424 --> 00:43:37,134
It's your anniversary.

418
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:40,221
Ah. Hmm.

419
00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:59,158
Well, it looks delicious.

420
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:01,617
We used the honeycomb
you gave us, Master.

421
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:03,619
Ah.

422
00:44:05,454 --> 00:44:07,790
Would you like to cut it, sir?

423
00:44:11,168 --> 00:44:14,505
That is a horseshoe, Mr. Philips.

424
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,632
I'm so sorry, sir.

425
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:21,802
- Would a knife be more appropriate?
- No, it's...

426
00:44:21,804 --> 00:44:23,472
It's all right.

427
00:44:34,483 --> 00:44:36,777
It's the bee's knees.

428
00:44:38,862 --> 00:44:40,155
Mmm.

429
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:52,710
Happy anniversary, Master.

430
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:08,142
You had discarded
some drawings of it, sir.

431
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:12,855
The pieces were most intricate.

432
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:16,525
But I tried my very best
to get it to function.

433
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:19,528
I...

434
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:23,741
wanted to surprise you, sir.

435
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:28,996
It's exquisite, Mr. Philips.

436
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:35,092
Speaking of surprises, I
have a surprise for you.

437
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:39,046
I've started writing a play.

438
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:42,384
It's a tragedy in five acts.

439
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:48,557
When it's finished, I
want the two of you...

440
00:45:51,101 --> 00:45:53,393
to play the leading roles.

441
00:45:56,565 --> 00:45:58,734
And what do you call it, Master?

442
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:05,113
<i>The Watchmaker's Son.</i>

443
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:09,578
<i>The Watchmaker's Son.</i>

444
00:46:13,628 --> 00:46:16,077
ROSIE, EMMA: Truman, President
Eisenhower, President...

445
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,834
Okay, we get it!

446
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:21,350
ROSIE, EMMA: ...Nixon, President
Ford, President Redford!

447
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:24,302
- All right, baby girl!
- I'm gonna get another bottle.

448
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:26,514
Rosie and
Emma, I am officially convinced

449
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,638
that one day another little
girl will be listing your names.

450
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,723
You hear that?

451
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:34,267
Maybe Aunt Jane will be
your campaign manager.

452
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:36,645
Alas, as wonderful a president

453
00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:39,439
as you both would be,
I've quit politics.

454
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:43,944
My mommy quit her
job too. She was a policeman.

455
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:48,156
Um, I didn't quit,
sweetheart. I retired.

456
00:46:48,158 --> 00:46:50,158
What's the difference?

457
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,077
Topher, don't be disrespectful.

458
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,955
Better not stand up for her or
she'll take away your TV too.

459
00:46:54,957 --> 00:46:57,124
All right.

460
00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:59,042
Cal, I'm taking away your TV.

461
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:01,389
Ha-ha! Mommy took your TV away!

462
00:47:01,392 --> 00:47:02,905
Wait a minute.

463
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,172
What happened? What'd I miss?

464
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:06,174
ROSIE, EMMA: No TV for anybody!

465
00:47:06,176 --> 00:47:09,803
Oh, no! That's horrible!

466
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:12,264
Cal, this
was a wonderful meal.

467
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:16,601
Totally worth getting
ditched for <i>Oklahoma.</i>

468
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:18,478
Ditched for what?

469
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,442
Oh.

470
00:47:22,986 --> 00:47:24,987
Oh, well, you didn't even tell him?

471
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:29,573
- I spared him.
- What? What's happening?

472
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:32,659
You didn't know that your sitter bailed?

473
00:47:32,661 --> 00:47:34,953
Babe, you hate musicals.

474
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,491
Nobody hates <i>Oklahoma!</i>

475
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:41,835
- You did.
- No. I thought it was great.

476
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:44,379
Then why'd you tell me at intermission

477
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:46,381
that their hearts weren't in it, hmm?

478
00:47:46,383 --> 00:47:48,842
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah...

479
00:47:48,844 --> 00:47:52,637
He's just jealous because he
played Curly in high school.

480
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:53,847
No way!

481
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:55,348
ROSIE, EMMA: Who's Curly?

482
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,518
Curly... Curly is the star of <i>Oklahoma.</i>

483
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,897
He gets the girl, he kills the bad guy,

484
00:48:01,899 --> 00:48:04,524
- and he sings a lot.
- Sing, Uncle Judd!

485
00:48:04,526 --> 00:48:06,902
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, Uncle Judd, sing!

486
00:48:06,904 --> 00:48:08,069
No. No!

487
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:12,910
All: Sing! Sing! Sing!

488
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:40,519
Of course he sings.

489
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:01,748
Oh, my turn.

490
00:49:33,615 --> 00:49:34,915
Watch batteries?

491
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:37,826
Mm-hmm. Pulled a duffle
out of that plane you blew up.

492
00:49:37,828 --> 00:49:39,536
There was a couple
hundred of them in there.

493
00:49:39,538 --> 00:49:41,788
Well, can't you just buy
those at any old store?

494
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,418
No. Not anymore, they're the old
kind. The synthetic lithium...

495
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,837
the ones that were making people sick.

496
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,172
Oh, I get it.

497
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:53,341
Kavalry's gonna make a cancer bomb.

498
00:49:53,343 --> 00:49:54,801
I don't know.

499
00:49:54,803 --> 00:49:57,470
But that fucker in the video
said that they had a mission,

500
00:49:57,472 --> 00:50:00,056
and it was gonna happen soon.

501
00:50:00,058 --> 00:50:01,810
Aren't you worried?

502
00:50:02,644 --> 00:50:04,146
Oh, Angela.

503
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,646
I'm worried as fuck.

504
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:13,987
Hey. What are you two
talking about that's taking so long?

505
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:17,699
Oh, nothing. Just the end of the world.

506
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:20,744
Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock. Ticktock.

507
00:50:26,543 --> 00:50:28,545
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

508
00:50:29,921 --> 00:50:32,215
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

509
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,011
<i>Evil is rising.</i>

510
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:40,180
<i>Second by second we all cry out...</i>

511
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:44,476
Yes, sir. You
bet. We got them all.

512
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:48,521
Well, shooter took some
sort of damn poison pill

513
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:52,694
before we could interrogate
him, but... you know.

514
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:54,903
Uh, well...

515
00:50:54,905 --> 00:50:59,032
Yeah, there's always a
chance of reprisal, Governor,

516
00:50:59,034 --> 00:51:00,909
but we just gave 'em a pretty good taste

517
00:51:00,911 --> 00:51:03,205
of what happens when
you take one of ours.

518
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:05,997
Well, you're welcome, Governor.

519
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:07,542
Bye now.

520
00:51:08,585 --> 00:51:11,880
- How'd I do?
- You sounded very confident.

521
00:51:12,881 --> 00:51:18,385
That's because, my dear,
I am full of confidence.

522
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:21,638
Yeah, I noticed some of it
coming out of your nose at dinner.

523
00:51:25,894 --> 00:51:28,019
It's been a tough week.

524
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:29,729
Yeah.

525
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:39,449
It's the hospital.

526
00:51:40,242 --> 00:51:42,744
- Charlie Sutton just woke up.
- Oh.

527
00:51:44,746 --> 00:51:47,372
<i>I'm gonna
change into my uniform,</i>

528
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:51,084
<i>and I'm gonna go over there
and I'm gonna see him.</i>

529
00:51:51,086 --> 00:51:54,713
<i>Baby, maybe you shouldn't drive.</i>

530
00:51:54,715 --> 00:51:57,426
<i>I'll get one of the
boys out front to take me.</i>

531
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:03,932
<i>You don't have to wait up for me.</i>

532
00:52:36,965 --> 00:52:39,174
<i>But it's a
helluva name, isn't it?</i>

533
00:52:39,176 --> 00:52:41,301
<i>Senator Joe Keene was a real cowboy,</i>

534
00:52:41,303 --> 00:52:44,262
<i>unlike our current Sundancer in Chief.</i>

535
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:47,223
<i>Thirty years of Redford and
what've we got to show for it?</i>

536
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:49,809
<i>More land we can't live on,
more animals we can't kill,</i>

537
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:52,729
<i>and a six-month wait to get
a gun for our own protection.</i>

538
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:55,148
<i>Hell, if Joe Junior wants to mount up</i>

539
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,776
<i>and gallop into the White
House, I say let him ride!</i>

540
00:53:39,653 --> 00:53:40,737
Shit.

541
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:53,041
Oh! Jeez...

542
00:54:09,307 --> 00:54:11,474
We should... we should answer that.

543
00:54:11,476 --> 00:54:15,353
No. I'm close, I'm close.

544
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:20,942
It's gonna wake up the kids.

545
00:54:20,944 --> 00:54:22,946
Okay, okay, okay.

546
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:25,907
Goddammit.

547
00:54:31,121 --> 00:54:32,996
Hello.

548
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:34,916
<i>Is this Angela Abar?</i>

549
00:54:36,602 --> 00:54:37,877
Yes.

550
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,298
<i>Is your father Marcus Abar?</i>

551
00:54:42,882 --> 00:54:44,674
Who is this?

552
00:54:44,676 --> 00:54:47,927
<i>Big oak tree out on Rowland Hill.</i>

553
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:50,265
<i>Something you need to see there.</i>

554
00:54:50,974 --> 00:54:52,932
<i>I know who you are,</i>

555
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:54,851
<i>so don't wear no goddamned mask.</i>

556
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:01,276
What?

557
00:55:14,956 --> 00:55:17,790
Watch the street. If anybody
pulls up other than me,

558
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:20,003
fucking shoot 'em before
they get to the porch.

559
00:55:20,962 --> 00:55:22,255
Okay.

560
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:25,441
Turn it off!

561
00:56:25,443 --> 00:56:28,029
Or I'll shoot!

562
00:58:29,193 --> 00:58:35,334

<i>Who are you?</i>

564
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,162
<i>I'm the one who
strung your chief of police up.</i>

565
01:00:46,996 --> 01:00:50,039
You're 90 fucking years old,
how the fuck did you hang him?

566
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:52,961
I am 105, and you curse too much.

567
01:00:54,379 --> 01:00:55,797
<i>You didn't kill him.</i>

568
01:00:57,298 --> 01:00:59,008
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

569
01:01:00,885 --> 01:01:03,526
Just get those fuckers
who did this to him.

570
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,682
Okay.

571
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:11,102
Laurie Blake, FBI. I'm here to help.

572
01:01:11,104 --> 01:01:13,481
<i>Folks assume
the Seventh Kalvary did it.</i>

573
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:15,898
But that's not what you assume?

574
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,112
<i>There are people who
believe that this world...</i>

575
01:01:20,321 --> 01:01:21,864
is fair and good.

576
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:25,326
<i>It's all lollipops and rainbows.</i>

577
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:27,630
<i>We don't do lollipops and rainbows.</i>

578
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:29,382
<i>'Cause we know those are pretty colors,</i>

579
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,503
<i>that just hide what
the world really is...</i>

580
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:34,667
black and white.

581
01:01:37,797 --> 01:01:40,798
<i>The only
way to stave off mankind's extinction</i>

582
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,637
<i>is with a weapon more powerful
than any atomic device.</i>

583
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:47,181
<i>That weapon...</i>

584
01:01:50,906 --> 01:01:51,990
<i>is fear.</i>

585
01:01:55,857 --> 01:02:00,361
<i>There's a vast and
insidious conspiracy at play.</i>

586
01:02:04,365 --> 01:02:06,761
I have a secret plan to save humanity.

587
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:09,073
<i>And it starts in Oklahoma.</i>

588
01:02:10,872 --> 01:02:13,041
She threatens to disrupt the peace.

589
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:18,089
<i>Are we safe, Angela?</i>

590
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:20,882
What did you do?

591
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:25,384
Mankind is ready for change.
