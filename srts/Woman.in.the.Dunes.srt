2
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,340
What's the matter, mister?
The water's come!

3
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,000
Here now.

4
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,820
Hold your left hand lower.
Try using your right hand...

5
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,720
...get less tired then.

6
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,090
Not enough sleep.

7
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,070
You can rest.
You're not used to it yet.

8
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:02,970
Were my veins filled with cement,
I bet I'd feel this way.

9
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,950
Get tired at first.

10
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,890
Will I ever get used to it?

11
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,330
You will.

12
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,930
I don't know.

13
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,200
Don't you feel
all this is meaningless?

14
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,370
Are you raking sand to live,
or living to rake sand...?

15
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,770
Of course, it's not so much fun
as Tokyo.

16
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,350
I'm not talking about Tokyo!

17
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,820
How can you stand being
trapped like this?

18
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,330
But it's my home.

19
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,400
Then demand your rights.

20
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,640
In my case, it's only till
I'm rescued.

21
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,040
Rescued?

22
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,220
Of course.

23
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,410
Away a week without leave.
Someone will call on me.

24
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:22,390
They'll see the book left open
in my room...

25
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,860
...the small change in my pocket.

26
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,540
They're bound to wonder.

27
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,870
But for you,
it's a lifelong problem.

28
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,610
My family's graves are here.

29
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,210
Yes, my husband and girl...

30
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,350
Then you...?

31
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,760
You'll leave if they're dug up?

32
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,900
You know how to make them
let down the ladder.

33
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,970
I've nothing to do outside.

34
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,370
You could walk around!

35
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,440
Walk around?

36
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,910
Yes!
It's great to walk around freely!

37
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,850
Wouldn't you get more tired
just walking around?

38
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,120
Don't joke!

39
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,520
Even dogs go crazy tied up
forever!

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,060
And we're men!

41
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,410
But if it weren't for the sand,

42
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,070
no one would bother about me.

43
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,080
Isn't it so? Even you...

44
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,980
Look, here's one.

45
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,350
Stop it!

46
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,820
This is what I came out here
looking for.

47
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,690
A kind of tiger-beetle.

48
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,670
Got any scissors?

49
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,410
Scissors?

50
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,980
I just want to clip my beard.

51
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,580
I think I have some...

52
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,600
They're not very sharp.

53
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,170
They're pretty rusty.

54
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,700
The sand does it.

55
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,760
They don't work.

56
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,050
No?

57
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,060
Not even close.

58
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,200
We'll ask for a razor
when they bring the ration.

59
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,970
See? The sand in my beard
makes it all scratchy.

60
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,170
Really! That sand just makes
a mess of everything.

61
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,550
Say, hurry up!

62
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,650
All right! Thanks!

63
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,320
Where's your "husband"?

64
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,980
Stomachache. Chilled, perhaps.

65
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,960
Love him too much?

66
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,960
A bath? Shall I help?

67
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,960
No, I'm tired today.

68
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,660
I'd like one.

69
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,530
No, you're sick.

70
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,900
My body feels sticky.

71
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,840
I must have sweated in bed.

72
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,980
I can boil it...

73
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,510
Let's. I'll help.

74
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,180
Never mind, I'll do it.

75
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,850
Thinking?

76
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,790
Not especially.

77
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,260
I'll take you. Stand there.

78
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,960
No, don't.

79
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,960
Come on.

80
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,270
Smile now.

81
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,350
Want to go home?

82
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,680
Why?

83
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,480
A radio would be good for you.

84
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,900
You'd hear about the world.

85
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,300
Silly!

86
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,210
You'd know all about Tokyo then.

87
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,110
That's what started me
collecting insects.

88
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:25,310
Having my name in an insect
book's better than nothing.

89
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,790
But a radio would take your
mind off things.

90
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,660
I see.

91
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,900
Finish off that sake?

92
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,570
You're still sick.

93
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,140
Helps you sleep.

94
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,510
I feel sleepy enough without it.

95
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,920
Be a sport.

96
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,460
I can't drink.

97
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,440
Never mind. I feel like it today.

98
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,240
Looks boiling.

99
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,900
Come on.

100
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,340
You amaze me.

101
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,840
Now, drink up.

102
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,670
My, that feels good.

103
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,420
You're cruel, when I'm so tired.

104
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,730
Help!

105
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,470
Someone help me!

106
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,880
Help!

107
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,860
Catch hold of it.

108
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:07,560
Please pull me out with this.

109
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,700
We can't pull you out
like a root.

110
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,440
We'll dig you out.
Grab on to the board.

111
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,880
Good thing we made it.

112
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:29,290
Quicksand around here.
Even the dogs won't come near.

113
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,960
How many people fell in before?

114
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,830
Hikers don't know about it.

115
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,400
If we dug, might find
something valuable.

116
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,830
Two or three cameras for sure.

117
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,830
Be quiet.

118
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,870
I'm sorry.

119
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,040
Shall I make some tea?

120
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,970
What's the time?

121
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,280
I don't know... about 8:30?

122
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,250
I failed.

123
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,620
Yes.

124
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,730
Complete and utter failure.

125
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,870
Do you have...

126
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,170
...a wife?

127
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,450
In Tokyo...

128
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,820
That's no concern of yours.

129
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,520
No.

130
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,720
But it's too bad.

131
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:14,030
If I'd succeeded, I was going to
buy a radio and send it to you.

132
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,200
A radio?

133
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,400
You wanted one...

134
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,980
That's all right.
You don't have to do that.

135
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,950
I can do piece-work
and buy one here.

136
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,480
I failed.

137
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,930
Shall I wipe you up?

138
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,130
I should have known the geography.

139
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,150
They'll always come after me.

140
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:07,060
Behind me will be friends,
a cooperative...

141
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,320
...the Board of Education
and the PTA...

142
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,730
They won't leave me to my fate.

143
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,160
Come on. I'll wash you.

144
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,420
What is it?

145
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,930
My hope.

146
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,940
A crow trap.

147
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,280
I leave a bait here.

148
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:07,280
When a crow gets it,
the sand will swallow it.

149
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,080
But crows are very clever.

150
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,180
Hunger makes them stupid.

151
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,790
But why is this your hope?

152
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,400
It is.

153
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:33,110
I'll tie a letter to its leg
asking for help.

154
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:40,920
They don't come.
It's almost three months.

155
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,750
Who?

156
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,450
Your rescuers.

157
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,400
They may think you ran away...

158
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,210
Tired of your work.

159
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,840
Hardly.

160
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,590
I left my bankbook.

161
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,080
I left my book open on my desk.

162
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,820
Anyone would know.
The room's screaming for help.

163
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,360
What's there?

164
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,930
What?

165
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,140
In Tokyo...

166
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,400
So I said to go and see!

167
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,610
It's too much.

168
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,920
Your ration!

169
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,730
Say, wait! Wait!

170
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,910
Let me up awhile!

171
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,600
Thirty minutes, once a day,
to see the sea!

172
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,380
I promise not to escape!

173
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,310
Twenty minutes! Even ten!

174
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,920
I've been good for three months!
I'm going out of my mind!

175
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,120
We'll talk it over and let you know!

176
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,730
Please! You can watch me!

177
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,540
Working hard.

178
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,400
Twenty more and I'll earn 1,000 yen.

179
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,450
Stupid!

180
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,070
I won't die like a dog!

181
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,090
Radio, nothing.
You'll be beyond help soon.

182
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,590
How can they be your friends?

183
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,160
I know it.

184
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,730
Everyone for himself.

185
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:20,070
Wagging your tail like a good dog.

186
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,230
Soon, we'll only have ourselves.

187
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,820
That can't be! We have the sand!

188
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:34,320
Sand? What's good in it?
Just makes trouble.

189
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,510
It sells.

190
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,490
Where?

191
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,590
At the town works.

192
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,320
Are you joking?
Against the law... it's salty!

193
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,460
In secret... at half price.

194
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,130
A total loss if it eats away
dams and buildings.

195
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,310
That's other people's business.

196
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:03,410
Yes, it's other people's business.

197
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,950
But this phony business
makes others rich.

198
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,620
Why help them?

199
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,650
The union buys and sells it.

200
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,990
They treat me very well.

201
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,980
I'll sift it.

202
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,010
Like building a house on water.

203
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,290
A boat might be better.

204
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,760
Why insist on a house?

205
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,500
But you want to go home, too?

206
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,530
That's...

207
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,040
Even a lie will do.

208
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,180
Perhaps, tomorrow...

209
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,490
If there's hope that
something may happen...

210
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:42,800
I'm so frightened each morning
when I go to sleep.

211
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,400
Afraid I'll wake up all alone again.

212
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,700
I'm really so frightened...

213
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,470
Put them in there.

214
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,580
Working hard, mister?

215
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,020
Too early for the carrier.

216
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,930
You want to see the sea?

217
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,600
Yes. Please! Will you let me?

218
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:17,200
We might consider it.

219
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:24,010
Please. I learned my lesson.
All right for an hour?

220
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,580
Then show us that.

221
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:37,030
Out in front, both of you,
where everybody can see you.

222
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,490
That?

223
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,570
Yes, that.

224
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,910
You know, with your old lady.

225
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,670
You know!

226
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:27,250
I asked the others.
They said, "sure"!

227
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,380
What're you doing? Hurry up!

228
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,030
What'll we do?

229
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,060
It's ridiculous!

230
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,920
It's my chance.

231
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,290
Don't listen.

232
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,670
Look, we needn't take it so
seriously.

233
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,000
What? We're not perverts!

234
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,050
We're pigs, anyhow!

235
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:02,130
Come on! Just pretend!

236
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
Fool! Fool! Fool!

237
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,540
Fool! Fool! Fool!

238
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,190
What's this?

239
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,810
Funny.

240
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,210
Not a drop of rain for three weeks.

241
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,110
Capillarity?

242
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,430
That's it!

243
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,950
It may mean
we'll have enough water.

244
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:01,920
Surface evaporation must be
acting as a suction pump.

245
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,520
The sand's a pump.

246
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,890
Like sitting on a pump.

247
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:18,100
Perhaps I can think of a more
effective system to store the water.

248
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,850
It's awful. Can't even breathe.

249
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,720
It'll be December soon.

250
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,700
Again.

251
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:29,100
Getting cold and food's scarce.
Easier to catch a crow.

252
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,110
Really, men are...

253
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:39,920
My turn to be the trapper.

254
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:50,760
If the radio came, we could
hear the weather report.

255
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,020
I'm afraid.

256
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,110
I'll bury it while the water boils.

257
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,520
Till tomorrow!

258
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,460
Help!

259
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,390
Someone, come here!

260
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,650
What is it?

261
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,120
Pains!

262
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,080
A baby.

263
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,180
A baby?

264
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,150
Since when?

265
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,390
October.

266
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:59,400
Hurt?

267
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,930
Nausea?

268
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:10,440
May be an abnormal pregnancy.

269
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,980
How do you know?

270
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,380
He used to shoe horses for
a veterinarian.

271
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,280
Anyway, call a doctor!

272
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,050
He'll be too late.

273
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,890
Doctors nowadays...

274
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,620
Get a small truck.

275
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,520
It's come.

276
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,850
I'm afraid.

277
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,900
Is the wind down?

278
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:17,100
Yes, it's quieter.

279
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:27,280
How?

280
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,410
Bedding and all.

281
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,580
Let's do it.

282
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,870
Put a board beneath.

283
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,170
Radio.

284
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,450
The radio.

285
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:07,390
Bad timing. Shall I open it?

286
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:20,900
Want to take it?

287
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,630
In the bedding.

288
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,540
Have you got another board?

289
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,740
Take one from the shelf
out back.

290
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,890
Below there. That one.

291
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,740
I don't want to go!

292
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,500
Listen, it's...

293
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:35,920
Something?

294
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:51,590
No, some other time.

295
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,580
I don't want to.

296
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,560
Pull her up!

297
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,240
No.

298
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,710
No...no...!

299
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:55,220
There's no need to rush away yet.

300
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:04,040
I am free to do as I like now.

301
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:14,110
What I want now is to tell someone
about the water tank.

302
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:19,550
It will be best to tell the villagers.

303
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,320
If not today, maybe tomorrow.

304
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:28,160
I'm sure I'll end up
telling somebody.

305
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,990
After that I can think of escaping.

306
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:45,640
REPORT OF MISSING PERSON

307
